			<h4>Google is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming, you easily get confused and caught up in little things. Google to the rescue! Or, most of the time, Stack Overflow to the rescue (it often pops up as the first and most helpful search result). Not only can you find most of your answers via Google, it also can be reassuring that many other people are struggling with the same things. Or that something that looked like a minor issue actually is quite major and you would never have been able to solve it from scratch, without the help of good old Google.</p>
