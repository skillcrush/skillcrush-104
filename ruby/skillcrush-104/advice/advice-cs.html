			<h4>What you are doing is IMPORTANT</h4>
			<p>You hear it a lot now, "Everyone should know how to code.  It's totatlly true!  Even if you just learn a bit, it will help you every single day.  Everything we do depends on some kind of technology and understanding what it takes to tell a computer what to do will be a huge benefit to you.</p>

			<h4>Try HARD to find the answer yourself</h4>
			<p>You hear a lot about not being afraid to ask questions and that is great advice - BUT it is also important to be able to find your own answers.  When you have spent time researching and taking notes, diagraming out your own solutions, you will understand and remember your solutions so much better than if you asked someone and they gave you the answer.</p>

			<p>That being said, it is also important to recognize when you have banged your head against the wall one too many times and you need some help.</p>
			<h4>Write simple test scripts</h4>
			<p>By taking 5 to 10 minutes to write out a few lines about what you expect your user to do and what you expect to happen, it really helps you plan your code.  Once you have written down - User provides birthday - you know you have to create a way to prompt them to provide their birthday, in the format you need.</p>
