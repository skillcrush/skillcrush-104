			<h4>The Best Advice My Dad Ever Gave Me</h4>
			<p>My father, now in his 78th year, is an early adopter. When I was in college in the mid-80s, 
			he begged me to try using a personal computer. I clung to my electric Smith-Corona with a death grip. 
			But by the time I was working on my Master's thesis in the <em>late</em> 80s, I agreed to give it a whirl.
			This was the age of DOS.</p>
			<p>My father was my own personal tech support... and he still is! And here is his excellent advice: 
			When the problem seems insurmountable, and you know you have tried everything, but it just isn't working, do the following:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Shut down the computer.</li>
			<li>Make a martini.</li>
			<li>Drink the martini and get a good night's sleep.</li>
			<li>Restart your computer in the morning.</li></ol>
			<p>This works almost every time!!!</p>

			<h4>What I Learned From Skillcrush</h4>
			<p>Of course I can do it! I'm Rosie the Riveter! I'm Wonder Woman! 
			(Actually, I'm a short Jewish girl from New Jersey, but Terminal doesn't know that.)</p>
			<h4>What You Should Know About Me</h4>
			<p>I could not for the life of me figure out how to change the font in the header or footer of this page.</p>
