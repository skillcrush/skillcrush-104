			<h4>Don't Be Afraid To Jump Around</h4>
			<p>Everyone learns at different rates and prefers different types of learning styles. If you are using a tutorial or course and you don't seem to be grapsing it. Look for another tutorial that will either help you figure it out or just move on to another. You can always go back and complete the first tutorial later.</p>

			<p>I know it sounds like a recipe for disaster but this has worked well for me. There are lots of resources out there free and paid. Start with free ones and free trials to get a feel for what the tutorial is like. If you like it go for it. if you don't find another one.</p>.

			<p>It's a journey. Keep it moving and make sure to have fun!</p>
