			<h4>Practice, Practice, Practice!</h4>
			<p>It's a common belief that practice makes perfect, and I totally agree! Though I'm a devout believer, it's often hard to muster up the motivation to keep at a new skill. It can also be discouraging to see others so much better (and so much younger!) than you pumping out amazing stuff.</p>
			<p>The one thing to remember is that everyone has put their time in to achieve their level of greatness—natural talent or not! So find a project that interests you and use that as your motivation to practice your new skill. Get excited about the end result—and the journey getting there!</p>
		
			<h4>Sometimes A Break is Just What You Need</h4>
			<p>I often get frustrated or bored with what I'm working on if I spend too much time on it. Taking a break changes up my scene, gives my brain a reboot and allows me to think clearly again.</p>

			<p>Sometimes it's the change of pace that reignites your love for your project. Don't feel guilty for taking breaks! They're a necessary part of the process.</p>
