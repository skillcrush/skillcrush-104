			<h4>Find a coding group!</h4>
			<p>My advice would be to find a supportive community to get you past the feeling that you don't understand and therefore coding isn't for you. This is just a passing feeling, and it's not real! Coding is for you! One of the best things about it is that coders like to help each other.</p>
			<p>If you have a coding group that meets regularly, this is the best. If you run into problems you can bring the issue to them and they can take a look.</p>
			<p>In addition to solving the problems in your code, the best part of this is that you will sweep a way any doubts you had in your mind about your abilities, because you'll see that it's all about working together.</p>
