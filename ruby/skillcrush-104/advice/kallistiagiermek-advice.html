			<h3>Try your best to stay on schedule!</h3>
			<p>When you start, you may fly through the challenges. This will lead you to think "If I miss a day, no big deal! I will just do double work tomorrow" This sounds all nice and dandy but trust me, the lessons get more difficult! Keep up as to not overwhelm yourself. Also, the more difficult lessons are the more fun so don't fret too much!  </p>

    </div>
		<div class="advice2">
			<h3>Write along with the videos </h3>
			<p>While watching the videos I have found it extremely helpful to have a text editor or my terminal open. I position my screen to be 75% video and 25% workspace then I write EVERYTHING as Adda or Emily writes it on the screen and it really helps it stick. See the example below. </p>
