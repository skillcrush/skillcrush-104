			<h4>"Great people do things before they are ready."</h4>
				<p>Jump in with both feet, trust yourself, and try your best. You never know where an opportunity will lead you.</p>
					
			<h4>Don't ever stop learning</h4>
				<p>Say it with me: "Google is your very best friend." The answer is out there and everything is figure-outable.</p>
				
			<h4>Have a goal</h4>
				<p>Mine? Fund our entire Disneyland vacation (including a stay at the Disneyland Hotel!) next year solely from freelance jobs... I'm &#188; of the way there!</p>
