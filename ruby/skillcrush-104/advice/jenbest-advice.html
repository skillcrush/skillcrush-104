			<h4>You are here.</h4>
			<p>At some point, everyone was a beginner... Everyone. You have to start somewhere. You are here.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="three">
			<h4>Google is now your best friend. (As if it wasn't already.)</h4>
			<p>Ask it things.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="four">
			<h4>Sometimes you need to take a break.</h4>
			<p>When you find yourself at an impasse and nothing is working... take a break. Walk away. Breathe. Do some yoga. Take a nap. Walk the dog. DO SOMETHING ELSE. Come back to it later, it will help. I promise.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="five">
			<h4>It's ok.</h4>
			<p>It really is ok... or it will be... so you might as well act like everything is already ok. Because it is.</p>
