			<h4>There is no shame in googling!</h4>
			<p>You are going to be confused. You are going to be so confused you don't even know which questions to ask! The good news is that lots of other people have been there before. StackOverflow and Google have been so helpful for me!</p>
		
			<h4>Read your error messages!</h4>
			<p>I've been so used to not understanding much surrounding computers. It was actually a surprise when I read error messages in the command prompt and understood, if not why I had a problem, at least what the general issue was. I had to get used to thinking of error messages of helpful hints, rather than automatically assuming it was incomprehensible gibberish.</p>
