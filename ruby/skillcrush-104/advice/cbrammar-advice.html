			<h4>Don’t just copy/paste code from tutorial sites!</h4>
			<p>I learned more when I looked at the code of other developers and played around with it, trying to understand their approach. It takes longer, but it’s a much more effective learning experience.</p>

			<h4>Just build it!</h4>
			<p>Don’t worry about not having the complete skill set to finish the project. You’ll acquire it through the process and come across problems and solutions you didn’t even know existed. After a while, you’ll start looking back at your code and seeing how you can improve on it and introduce new and more advance technologies and frameworks.</p>
		
			<h4>Get used to writing clean, readable code!</h4>
			<p>This way, others can understand it, and when you come back to it 6 months later you won’t have to decipher it again. Clean code is also less prone to bugs and other issues.</p>

			<h4>Think, write, test, refactor, repeat!</h4>
			<p>Think before you start writing code – what are you trying to do? How will you know if it works? Test your code, and after optimizing – refactor. Many less experienced developers skip this critical step.</p>

			<h4>Keep it simple!</h4>
			<p>When starting out, don’t be afraid to choose a programming language that simplifies development at the expense of performance. While languages such as C/C++ will be an important part of your toolkit later on, your first programming language should be one that offers suitable abstraction, such as Python or Ruby, so you can learn faster and focus on understanding fundamental concepts.</p>
