		<h3>These are my top 2 tips for new coders &mdash; like you.</h3>

			<h4>Build projects. Don't collect badges.</h4>
			<p>Look for courses &ndash; like <a href="http://skillcrush.com">Skillcrush</a> &ndash; where you will be building real-world projects as you learn new skills. Some sites are great because they're free and can introduce you to new skills. Use these to help you evaluate whether or not you want to pursue that coding language. But, don't spend too much time collecting badges. </p>
			
			<p><strong>Concepts and theory are important, but application proves understanding.</strong></p>

			<p>Look for courses where you will be building a project as your end-result so that you'll have professional pieces for your portfolio. Yes &ndash; even before you get clients. I didn't do this enough when I first got started. Now, whenever I take a course to learn a new skill or build upon an existing skillset, my goal is to end up with a project that can be added to my portfolio.</p>

			<h4>Teach others.</h4>
			<p>It's true what they say. Teaching a skill to others will help you to solidify your understanding and knowledge of a new skill. </p>

            <p>There will always be someone one step behind you, so teach it to <em>that</em> person. You can create YouTube videos or get involved in groups. Help out by answering questions whenever you can.</p>
