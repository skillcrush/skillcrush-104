			<h4>Confusion is your friend! </h4>
			<p> This is often said throughout the lesson, but I want to enforce it here. I always have trouble admitting I don't know things or that I'm out of my depth, but it's really the only way you'll learn and improve.</p>
			<p> Admitting things are confusing and fixing it is much better than never learning new things! </p>
			
			<h4>Take things one step at a time. </h4>
			<p> When working on big projects or tasks, it's best to break everything up into small tasks. Otherwise, such large tasks (and especially with things you're not necessarily familiar with) can become overwhelming.</p>
			
			<h4>Being behind is okay!</h4>
			<p> Life is busy and hectic and sometimes you don't make all the goals you plan. Don't beat yourself up about this! Just keep going. You're doing your best and that's the most important thing.</p>
			
			<h4>Never give up!</h4>
			<p>Especially when you most want to!</p>
