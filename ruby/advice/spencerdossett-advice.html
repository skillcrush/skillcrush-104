			<h2>Less is more</h2>
			<p>Your first instinct when you learn to code is to try and write as much code as you can. Before you know it you take a look and everything just looks j<i>u<b>m</b></i>b<b>l</b><i>e</i>d. The secret is actually to try and <b>not<b> write code.</p>

			<p>It's counterintuitive at first but once you've written about 1000 lines of code you will start to see how much easier that code would be to manage if it was only 500 or 250 lines.</p>

			<h2>You don't need all the answers right away</h2>
			<p>Your goal is to know how you're going to go about solving problems you've never encountered before. You'll want to know where to get answers to your questions and start collecting those resources in one place</p>

			<p>Expect to be confused and not know the answer. Once you're comfortable with that you'll just get used to doing your ritual solve-a-problem research. </p>
