			<h4>Be Kind to yourself</h4>
			<p>It is going to take a while to master all the skills you need to become one of those coders you see in movie typing gibberish without having to keep checking how to write the code with your eyes closed.</p>

			<p>Until you get to that stage. Google is your friend and will remind you how the code is written, with lots and lots of experience using the code it will come automatically to you. For now, just. be. kind. to yourself.</p>

			<h4>Step away from the computer</h4>
			<p>I know you're crazy excited with all these super things you are doing and learning. But remember to take a shower, go for a walk, pet an animal, talk to a human being or two, live a bit of your life and come back to do some more coding.</p>

			<p>You will be a more balanced coder this way. Oh yes I forgot, do some yoga or some sort of excercise too!</p>
