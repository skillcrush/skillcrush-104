			<h4>Getting Started Is The Hardest Part</h4>
			<p>Learning Ruby (or any other programming language) is a skill that gets easier over time. At first, everything might seem foreign and confusing, but you should know that just by sticking with it, it will gradually start to make sense. Certain parts might be more challenging than others, but the only sure way to fail at understanding is to give up.</p>

			<h4>If you have a Mac, your installation will be easier!</h4>
			<p>I am primarily a Windows guy, but trying to install Ruby and Rails on my Windows box was a nightmare. I had a Macbook that I mostly used for DJ-ing, and after about two whole days of unsuccessfully trying to get Rails and Ruby running on Windows, I switched over to the Mac and all my problems were solved, I had it up and running in about 30 minutes.</p>

      <p>This is not a religious Mac testimonial; I still consider myself a Windows guy.  I just wish I had started my Ruby / Rails tutorials on the Mac first, as it would have saved me several weeks (the 2 days of painful installation attempts, plus another few weeks of procrastination). </p>


      <h4>Make some progress EVERY day.</h4>
      <p>Some days I barely have enough time and energy to do anything. But if I put it off, I fall behind easily. So I try to do a little coding every single day. On the days that I am not able to code, I try to at least read about coding.  I bought several Ruby books on Amazon so I can still feel like I am learning something on my breaks at work (where wi-fi is unavailable because I currently work outside the tech sector and they apparently dont want us hogging their bandwidth).</p>
