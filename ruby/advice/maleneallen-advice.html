			<h4>Hang In There</h4>
			<p>It only gets better!</p>

			<p>I see coding and design as a way out of a not so happy life.</p>

			<h4>It's Hard Sometimes</h4>
			<p>With hard work and determination nothing in life is impossible.</p>

			<p>When you finish the course, don't be afraid to take risks(moving to another state,city, or country for work).</p>

			<p>Volunteering at a tech company counts as experience.</p>

			<p>Self doubt is man's/woman's greatest weakness, believe in yourself, even if no one else does.</p>
