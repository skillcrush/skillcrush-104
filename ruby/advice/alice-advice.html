			<h4 class="alice-advice">Do Not Expect Perfection</h4>
			<p class="alice-advice">Do not expect perfection: it rarely exists.  You are learning, and expecting perfection is just piling on extra stress on yourself that you do not need.  Right now, just enjoy learning and have fun with it.  Even if you don’t get something to work, you get to put on your detective hat and figure out what’s keeping it from working.  Once you get something to work, you’ll get that warm satisfied feeling!  Embrace it!</p>
			<br>
            <p class="alice-advice">Now, look at your work again and try to make it better.  It’s like trying to beat your best score at a video game.  You still beat the game.  Never forget that.  You take pride in your work and want to make it better, like all the software and hardware updates in the technological field.  You want to beat your own best score.</p>
            <div class="alice-advice">
			<h4>Other random tips:</h4>
			<ul>
			<li>Practice!</li>
			<li>Take breaks (or even a nap!) whenever your brain feels like mush.</li>
			<li>Believe in yourself.</li>
			<li>Ask questions, help out when you can, and look at other's work</li>
			<li>Celebrate each step of the way.</li>
			<li>There is always room for improvement, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't take pride in your work.</li>
			<li>Who says you can't have fun when it doesn't go smoothly? Just enjoy the ride and keep going!</li>
			</ul>
