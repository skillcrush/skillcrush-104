			<h4>You need to relearn how to learn!</h4>
			<p>Learning how to learn to code is the most challenging part of learning how to code.</p>
			<p>You will feel like you are doing something wrong constantly, until you figure out how to learn how to learn to code.</p>
			<h4>Get comfortable with being uncertain, and using trial and error as a learning tool.</h4>
			<p>You will feel that youa are doing something "wrong" or not "understanding" until you become comfortable with using trial and error as a learning tool. It is in fact your most powerful learning tool.</p>

			<p>You must also learn to let go of the feeling that you are doing something "wrong". The important thing is to understand the concepts you are trying to make function, and then trying things until you find what works.</p>

			<p>You also need to give yourself permission take breaks, if you continue pushing past a certain point you will only confuse yourself more. Learning the power of the strategic break will save you many headaches and ruined codes.</p>
