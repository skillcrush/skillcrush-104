		<h1>Hi my name is Tricia and I have just a little bit of advice about coding that I would
			 like to share with you!</h1>

			<h4>Think about your code before writing</h4>
			<p>Stop and think about what the end goal before starting to write your code.
			Break everything down into tiny, miniscule steps if you have to. It truly helps
			the mind to organize each step that needs to be taken. One instructor told me
			practice by taking a simple, everyday task and write out every single step that
				has to take place to get your body to complete the task.
			</p>

			<h4>Simply look at code</h4>
			<p>Just looking at code helped me think about all of the elements that go into
				a simple online document or web page. I found the more I looked at code while
				I was learning, the easier it became to recall which components of code are needed
				to accomplish a coding task.</p>

			<h4>Practice Practice Practice!</h4>
			<p>I definitely did not practice enough! Give yourself simple tasks/assignments to
				complete in addition to the class assignments. Don't let a lot of time go between
				times you sit down and write code. The more you use it the better you'll be at it!</p>
