			<h4>Figure out what you want to build first</h4>
			
			<p>If learning how to code is hard enough, figuring out how to start is harder! There are so many different programming language out there that it gets extremely confusing. It may even dissuade you from even starting. I know I almost quit in this stage. I learned, however, there is a different approach. You need to start with a project in mind--something that you can call yours.</p>

			<p>Start with figuring out what you want to build. By doing this from the start, you begin your coding journey with a purpose. Everytime you get confused on what your next step in the learning process should be, go back to thinking about what else you need to learn to make your project happen. Curiosity will naturally take form and will motivate you to keep going.</p>
