			<h1>Hi my name is Kim and I have some advice for you!</h1>

			<h4><strong>If at first you don't succeed, try try again. (And then try some more...)</strong></h4>
			<p>My advice is to realize that when you start to code it will be both frustrating and gratifying.  One minute you will be pulling your hair out trying to understand a concept, and the next you will be doing a happy dance that your code worked (it actually worked!!!).</p>

			<p>Embrace this see-saw of emotion.  Know that everytime you don't understand something, you eventually will.  It's like a jigsaw puzzle.  There are a ton of pieces haphazardly spread about.  The picture is unclear but if you take your time, one piece at a time, you can put it all together.   </p>
		
			<h4><strong>Ask for help (often)</strong></h4>
			<p>Utilize all the help that is available.  I hate to ask for help, but I have quickly gotten over that character flaw since I've begun coding.  So send the instructor an email or get to an online forum.  And remember: Google is your friend!</p>

			<p>I have an index card with a mantra that sits on my desk.  It reads "If coding is difficult, code more".  It will get easier and you will get more awesome.</p>
