			<p>Invest in a good reference manual, it will be worth it, 100%</p>
			<p>Sometimes the lessons will kind of trick you, but don't sweat it.</p>
			<p>Don't stop with the lessons, going above and beyond the basic requirements is totally worth it.</p>
			<p>Many programmers will be pendantic, and argumentative. Everyone else is rolling their eyes at them though.</p>
			<p>Figuring out why something isn't working, and fixing it is the best feeling.</p>
