			<h4>Learning</h4>
			<p>Doing something new can be frightening, but taking small steps helps in conquering it.</p><br>

			<p>Some people talk about Confusion as part of the learning process.  Is real! Sometimes the feeling can be overwhelming, and for some the natural response is to stop. Don't, it takes time to assimilate new learning.</p><br>

			<p>When you keep going through the lessons and doing the challenges, little by little everything becomes a bit clear. You should keep in mind that in addition to asking questions, sometimes it helps to search the internet.</p><br>

			<h4>Perseverance and Passion are important in learning</h4>
			<p>Learning requires patience, which for some us is difficult to keep because we want quick results.  This is when perseverance comes in. When you believe you are not achieving things at the pace that you want, don't be dissapointed, this is natural.</p><br>

			<p>Perseverance allows you to keep going even if you see no progress or find many difficulties.</p><br>
			<p>We should keep in mind to take breaks and let the knowledge sink in. I know for some it may not be a choice because we are sometimes hardwired to keep going until we get it, but a break allows the brain to process information.</p><br>

			<p>Lastly, when you are passionate about something spending time on it won't matter. It will allow you to enjoy the process of discovering that each day you know a little bit more.</p><br>
