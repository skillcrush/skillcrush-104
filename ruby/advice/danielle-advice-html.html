			<h4>You can do it!</h4>
			<p>It's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes--learning to code is really difficult!</p>

			<p>But there's a whole wide internet out there and the SkillCrush community is super great so don't be afraid to ask for help!</p>
            
            <p>Make sure you take the time to work through the exercises so that you enforce the concepts, but if you're really stuck on something, take a break! Sometimes what you really need is to walk away from a difficult problem for a while and do something else--take a walk, do the dishes, watch a movie, whatever. When you come back, your brain will have had time to relax. I find that if I'm stuck and I take a break for a while and do something completely unrelated, usually the answer comes to me as soon as I've had enough time off from thinking about the problem.</p>
            
            <h4>You can learn to code. I believe in you!</h4>
            
            <p>Just because you're not "naturally talented" at something doesn't mean you can't become talented. Here's a secret: "natural talent" is kind of a myth. The reason people seem naturally talented at something is because they work hard at it. Why don't they look like it's hard work, you ask? Simple: they find a way to make it interesting and fun. If you're struggling to care about a particular project, maybe it's time to let it go and try something else. Sometimes taking a break can renew your interest.</p>
