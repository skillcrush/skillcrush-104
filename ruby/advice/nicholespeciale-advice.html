			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>I wish someone had told me this when I first started coding. I had hours of frustration looking at my errors or misplaced styling
			only to learn that 6-8 hours later I have to stop, walk away and do something else.</p>
			<p> When it comes down to it, confusion and frustration are actually good things. It means that your brain is adjusting to the concept
			and working hard to comprehend and output the right answers. </p>
			<p> In fact, the concepts that I felt most frustrated by I have remembered the best. So hang in there! It will get better I promise.</p>
