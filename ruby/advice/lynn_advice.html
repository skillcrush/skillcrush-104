			<h4>It's okay to ask for help!</h4>
			<p>When I first started learning how to code, I was self-taught.  I freelanced for a year doing web design and started teaching myself 
            how to do front end coding in HTML and CSS.  It was hard, and it took me forever to complete one website, let alone two at once.
            I realized that it's okay to ask for help, as everyone else out there has been in that same boat!<br /><br />
            I used various forums and wasn't afraid to email or Tweet someone with a question.<br /><br />
            The key thing to remember is to be specific with your questions, as people are very busy.  It helps to include a snippet of your code 
            with what you're trying to accomplish.</p>
