			<h4>Be patient with yourself!</h4>
			<p>When learning to code as well as programming, I had no idea of what I got myself into.  You see...all this was brand <strong>NEW</strong> to me.  Sometimes, I would become so frustrated with myself because I felt like it wasn't clicking and just wanted to give up. But I managed to keep pushing through.</p>
			<p>In order to survive, you have to learn patience with yourself.  Learning how to relax, laugh at yourself, and not get overly excited can be detrimental in any obstacle you pursue in life.  As Confusion stated "it is a sign that you are heading in the right direction."  So, take your time, learn the concepts, and ask plenty of questions.</p>
			<p> Before you realize it everything will not be a blur and things will finally come together.

			<h4>Most important part: Practice, Practice, Practice.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology or programming language there is never enough practice.  Practice when you are learning, practice for understanding, and practice to see if things could be done more efficiently.  The more you practice, it aids in your knowledge of understanding exactly what is happening and why its happening.</p>

			<p>The most critical part is training your mind and eyes to think and see things differently (as a programmer, designer, etc.).  Additionally, make sure your math skills are up to par because math is involved when dealing with technology.</p>
			<p>Most of all, please remember to  <em>enjoy</em> your learning experience and have <strong>FUN</strong>!  It lasts for only a short time frame and then you are on to something.</p>
