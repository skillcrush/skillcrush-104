			<h4>Get in there!</h4>
			<p>My best advice is stop thinking and start doing.  Get your hands dirty.  Reading concepts from a book is useful up to a certain point, if you don't apply what you've read in some way it won't stick.</p>
		
			<h4>Google it!</h4>
			<p>If you have a question, chances are someone's already asked it on the Internet and have gotten an answer if not many answers back from the programming community.  You'd be surprised at how many people have encountered the same roadblocks as you.</p>
