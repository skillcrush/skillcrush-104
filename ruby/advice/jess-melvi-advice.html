			<h4> Feel free to cheat! (Consider this an open-book, open-web, open-buddy exam)!</h4>
			<p> Use Google, use Stack Overflow, use your classmates and go ahead, look at the solution Skillcrush provides.  </p>
			<p> You will learn more studying, understanding, and synthesizing someone else's working 
			code into your own than you will banging your head against a wall. </p> 
			<br>
			
			<h4> Find your flow </h4>
			<p> Maximize the time you have to work. If you get stuck it's okay to work ahead a little if you can. Sometimes the next lesson will illuminate your problem or question.  </p>
			<p> Flow is a creative state where you feel "in the zone". It is usually both pleasant and rewarding. You should feel proud of yourself for all you are accomplishing! Don't mope.  </p>
			<p> Take breaks for you eyes, brain, and body. Sedentary work kills, so get up and take at least a
			tiny break every fifteen minutes, or whenever you feel stuck.  Getting up and moving around stimulates your mind, body, and soul! </p>
