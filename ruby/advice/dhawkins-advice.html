			<h4>Practice Practice Practice</h4>
			<div class="advice-item">			
				<p>When learning to code you will have to plan to spend lots of time practicing. The programming skill gets better with lots of practice. As a matter of fact it requires more time to practice than actually solving difficult problems. </p>

				<p>If you are starting out then I recommend identifying some time to spend to practice coding each day for a few months before you will actually feel comfortable programming.</p>
			</div>
				
			<h4>Challenge Self</h4>
			<div class="advice-item">
				<p>You will have plenty of opportunities to challeng yourself when you are learning to program.  Don't just do the exercises to complete them Only, challenge yourself.</p>


<p>It is when we challene ourselves that we really learn.  Stretch yourself towards the personal gpals you may have every day.</p>
