			<h4>Take things piece by piece</h4>
			<p>The idea of making an entire webpage/app can be pretty intimidating. Instead of trying to attack the whole
				thing at once, it's a great idea to break it up into smaller pieces. This way you're only having to 
				attack one bit by one bit. With each piece you conquer, you get closer to finishing the big picture, and 
				after a while, the whole thing is done.</p>
