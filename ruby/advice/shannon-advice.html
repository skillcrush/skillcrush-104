				<h4>Practice Practice Practice</h4>
				<p>When you first start learning to code don't stick to the first tutorial or lesson guide you find. Try all the different ways to learn programming there are. Not only does it keep the learning process interesting, you might find one method of learning is better for you than another, it also serves as extra practice.</p>
				<p>No matter how many times you come across a lesson that you've done before in another place, do it again, if you've got it down pat then it shouldn't take you long. And if you still need practice then it's another opportunity to get more practice.</p>
				<p>My biggest piece of advice is to keep seeking out practice until you can do whatever it is you're interested in, in your sleep. There's no such thing as too much practice. </p>
