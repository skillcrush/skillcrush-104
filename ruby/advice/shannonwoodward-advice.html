			<h4>#1 Read everything very carefully.</h4>
			<p>For newbies like me, learning to code takes a good deal of time and patience. But most importantly, it takes A LOT of focus! You can't just skim over your lesson resources. You HAVE to read them all very carefully, as you're going to encounter many new words and phrases.</p>

			<h4>#2 Google is your friend.</h4>
			<p>Having trouble understanding something in the lesson resources? Google it! There are so many great resources on the Internet that can help answer your questions and supplement your Skillcrush learning.</p>

			<h4>#3 Don't give up!</h4>
			<p>I can't stress this enough. Learning to code is EXACTLY like learning a new language. Practice as much as you can. Even if you're ready to pull you're hair out trying to figure out one of the lesson challenges, keep chugging along. You know what they say: practice makes perfect!</p>
