			<h4>Do you remember elementary school?</h4>
			<p>Back then, you learned many different things everyday. Your teacher drilled multiplication tables, long division, and fractions at you nonstop. You read many works of fiction and had to report back on the author's purpose and theme, descriptions of main characters and plot details. You memorized state capitals and key history events. Then you practiced a musical interest, played sports after school. Whew! Your were just a kid, and you plowed through the daily learning like a champ.</p>
			
			<h4>Learning is your friend, then and now!</h4>
			<p>At times, you loved the learning process. "Now I can read!" "I can play this song on the recorder!" "I know how much money I need to buy the candy I want!" When you experienced learning success, you gained confidence and and felt like a bigger kid. You could do more in your world and you understood it better.</p>
			
			<p>Yet there were times when the learning didn't come to you easily. You got stuck. Things didn't make sense. You were frustrated. You wanted to give up. Yet, there was a goal in sight, a desire to grow up and be able to be independent. So you hunkered down, asked for help, and were patient with yourself. And, eventually, you figured it out!</p>
			
			<h4>A little Patience, Yeah, Yeah!</h4>
			<p>When you learn to code, some things will seem to make sense and other things won't. You have to have a space here, but not there. You forget a tag, a semicolon, or parenthesis and the whole code won't work. You can't figure out your errors. It all looks unfamiliar. You move on two a new concept and you forget something you learned two weeks ago! Ahh! You can get totally overwhelmed, give up, and throw your computer our the window! Or you can take a few deep breaths, take a break outside, and resolve to become way more patient with yourself. </p>

			<p>Go back to the problem, the error message, or just the funny looking code with a renewed desire to solve the puzzle. Believe in the process, even if it takes you down roads of self doubt. Just a little more patience with yourself, and suddenly you may see how close you actually are to the finish line. </p>

			<h4>Water your seeds for creativity.</h4>
			<p>Technology innovates itself constantly. You've got to turn on your inner innovator to keep up! Push yourself towards divergent thinking so that you can come up with many ideas and solutions to problems. Collaborate with others and bounce your ideas off of each other. Be inspired by what other people create.</p>

			<p>Give yourself permission to nurture your creative side. Daydream. Look out the window every so often. Write in your journal. Let your mind continue to work when it's not officially "working". Your downtime may result in a huge breakthrough during your work time!</p>
