			<h4>When in doubt, Google it!</h4>
			<p>The web developer community is generous.  Developers like to share their knowledge &amp; help each other solve problems.  If you can't figure something out, Google it!  You're bound to find someone else who had a similar issue &amp; another someone else who was generous enough to help them resolve it.</p>
		
			<h4>Be that helpful person.</h4>
			<p>It's easy to feel self-doubting when you're learning something new.  One of the best ways to reinforce what you know is by teaching someone else.  Get on forums and help fellow coders when you can.  Even though you can't answer everything it will be a good reminder that you do know <em> some</em> things.</p>
