			<h4>Find a network of coders!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, but you are going to get stuck. You need to have people to go to when you need help.</p>

			<p>Check out facebook pages, stack overflow questions, quora, etc.</p>
			<h4>Practice, Practice, Practice</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>In order to keep your new skills fresh and commit them to your long-term memory, you need to make sure you are using them everyday.  Set aside some time for coding every day, even if it is only a few minutes!</p>
