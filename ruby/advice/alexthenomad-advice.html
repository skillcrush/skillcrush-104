			<h4>Don't Give Up!</h4>
			<p>When you've come to a roadblock in learning certain concepts, confusion may drive you to doubt your capabilities in coding. But did you know that we all learn differently depending on how something is taught?
			</p>
			<p> Yep that's right! The good news is that the internet is full of resources created from coders who all explain coding concepts differently. So if you find something is not clear in a specific course, try to find other resources that make more sense to you. Clarity is just a few clicks away. </p>
			<h4>Be Curious And Experiment</h4>
			<p>When learning code, practice everyday and experiment. You'd be surprised how much more of a learning experience you will have. You may just run into a new style or feature that will make employers swoon. </p>
			<h4>Read, Read, Read</h4>
			<p>Newsletters, tutorials, code samples on github, stack overflow...the more you expose yourself to the code, the faster you go on the learning curve.</p>
			<h4>Invest Your Time</h4>
			<p>Advanced coding takes practice and time and that certainly is not achievable when you're constantly checking your facebook or twitter accounts. Instead, upload some mobile coding courses or books on your phone and check those every chance you get. </p>
			<h4>Have Fun With Your Learning</h4>
			<p>If you think of your learning as work, it will make the experience all the more difficult. Have fun with it. Try making something you like. It may just turn out to be the highlight of your portfolio. </p>
