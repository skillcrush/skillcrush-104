			<h4>Don't get discouraged!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming, you might get frustrated when your code does not work. Don't get discouraged! Look at your error messages and go from there.</p>

			<h4>Take a break!</h4>
			<p>Sometimes you will feel like you are not getting anywhere with your code. That means it's time to take a break. Come back to it with fresh eyes and you'll have more energy to solve the challenge.</p>
