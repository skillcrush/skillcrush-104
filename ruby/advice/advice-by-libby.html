			<h4>Confusion is your friend! </h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. Embrace it! It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving and that you should just keep going.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>Nothing good has ever come from quitting. When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's an important part of the process.</p>
