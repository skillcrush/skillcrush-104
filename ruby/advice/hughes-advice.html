			<h3>Never, Never Give Up</h3>
			<p>The folks who make it look easy? It was once hard for them, too. In other words, those who are wildy successful never gave up when things seemed ridiculously confusing or terribly challenging. Those who succeed are not necessarily the smartest (although those people exist, too!), but they are the ones who never wavered from their goals, even when they felt like quitting.</p>


			<h3>Trust the experienced ones.</h3>
			<p>I cannot tell you how many times I have heard that programming doesn't make any sense at first, to practice, practice, practice, or to find a community. Don't brush off advice from experienced programmers! They've been in our shoes before, it'd be a shame to ignore their advice. </p>

			<h3>Be Patient</h3>
			<p>Be patient with yourself and be patient with the process. If you want to be a computer programmer, you will. (You have to want it, though!) If you don't udnerstand something right away, that's okay. Leave it alone for a bit, take a walk, then come back to it. Repeat this process until you do understand it. And be proud of yourself when you understand something new, even the small things.</p>

			<h3>Stop comparing!</h3>
			<p>Don't compare yourself to anyone else. It doesn't matter if you are not as advanced as your classmate, your friend, or your coworker. What matters is that you are constantly improving, learning, and putting in the effort. </p>

			<h3>Find Balance, Get Excited, Create things</h3>
			<p>Okay, so that was three pieces of advice rolled into one! But, to keep it short and sweet: Don't code ALL day; balance is important for our sanity. When you're feeling defeated (etc.), do something to excite you! Remind yourself why you started this journey. Lastly, create things. Sure, read books, do assginments, and undestand concepts...But create something! Many things! This is what makes it fun. A webiste, a game, a weather app...whatever, just do it. This builds your confidence and makes programming even more fun. </p>
