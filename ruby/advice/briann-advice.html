			<h4>Don't be timid!</h4>
			<p>Taking the first steps on the journey to learn how to code can be scary! But don't fret and, most importantly, don't be timid. Take the challenge by the horns and do your best.</p>

			<h4>Know your limits</h4>
			<p>Life will get in the way. Unless you are able to focus all of your energy on to this course, something will always get in the way. Getting sick, the kids/family, work, sleep, etc.</p>

			<p>Don't push yourself to do the work just because you are supposed to. Unless you have a looming deadline, it is better to take a breather and work through the class at your own pace. Rushing will get you done with the class, but likely will leave your gained knowledge wanting.</p>
