			<h4 >Persevere</h4>
			<p>Programming is amazing but it takes a lot of learning before it all comes together. Find some good tutorials and work through them. When you find you can't do something, google it and read what a few different people suggest. Remember the skillcrush motto of <strong> good, better, best </strong>. You can achieve the same results in many different ways in coding. Just get it done first, then think about how to do it better next time. Eventually you will know enough to design your code well from the outset. but don't stress about that for now.    

			<h4 >Work on real problems</h4>
			<p>At first you have to start on the toy problems, but as soon as you can, get to work on real problems. Make a website for a real customer, even if they aren't paying you. Write a program to automate a real annoying repetitive process. Have users who can test your solution and give input to guide your improvements. Don't keep it all in your own head.
