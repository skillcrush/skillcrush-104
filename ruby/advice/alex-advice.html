			<h4>Face Into Your Fear</h4>
			<div class="advice-item">			
				<p>When I first started programming, I would get overwhelmed or scared. But I soon realized that that sense of fear could be translated into exhilaration if I just embraced it.</p>

				<p>Basically, remember that whenever you are feeling afraid to take the next step, take a deep breath, remind yourself "Even if I fail, I'll give it a try." Just do your best - it's all you can do, and you will be surprised, that your best is pretty darn good.</p>
			</div>
				
			<h4>Think or Do?</h4>
			<div class="advice-item">
				<p>When first starting out, it feels like there is a constant battle between when to think and when to do. It can be tempting to spend a lot of time trying to grasp something conceptually, but remember that no amount of theoretical knowledge is a substitute for getting your hands dirty.</p>
				
				<p>Mistakes are a part of the process and will help you learn and grow. You will always learn more from making a mistake and figuring out how to fix it than from reading a book about how to do it right the first time. Debugging is part of the coding process, and will improve your understanding.</p>
			
				<p>That being said, a perfect time to spend some time thinking is right before you actually start to do! Before you start coding, try to figure out exactly what you're trying to do, and how you'll approach the coding task. That way, you have an idea of exactly what code you want to create. You can then try to code each piece of your code bit by bit. This will make it easier to get your code working.</p>
