			<p>I've noticed a pattern every time I encounter a problem while programming:

			<ul>
				<li>Hit a wall/something breaks</li>
				<li>Ugh, frustration!</li>
				<li>(Whining) I don't see an obvious solution!</li>
				<li>Wait...now a slight panic.</li>
				<li>Do I know how to fix this? Oh no, I don't know how to fix this.</li>
				<li>Snack/TV/reading/bathroom break</li>
				<li>Google problem, find a couple answers on stackoverflow</li>
				<li>Hack hack hack</li>
				<li>Panic subsides</li>
				<li>Problem eventually fixed or at least minimized</li>
				<li>I feel awesome.</li>
				<li>I realize I knew the answer all along.</li>
			</ul>

			</p>

			<p>Coding is problem solving. Every problem is an opportunity. Break the problem into pieces. Try to find the kernel of the issue, and Google the hell out of it until you find something that clicks.</p>

			<p>And eventually you will. Every time.</p>
