			<h4>Patience is everything!</h4>
			<p>I don't consider myself a patient person. I cook on super high heat, blurt things out in conversations etc. If you're anything like me then, programming is an opportunity to learn patience, simply because you're forced to! You can't know what you don't know, you can't control everything, and you're often collaborating.</p>

			<p>When the task you've set out to do is already taking three times as long as what you have alotted for, you need to analyze. Assess where your current project fits in with your overall programming goal, where that goal fits in with your life, and if you have time to finish the task at present or if you need to postpone it.</p>

			<h4>Joy and communication are skills too.</h4>
			<p>After all that analyzing, if you decide that finishing this current project is the way you need to spend your time, why not do it with joy instead of axiety? Settle in, set a pomodoro timer, and try to relax and emjoy yourself!</p>

			<p>If taking your time with a programming project is not an option because of other cherished priorities, it's an opportunity to hone your communication skills. First with yourself. Feel secure about the decision you made by explaining to yourself why you decided to stop for the day. If you need to explain it to others, do so.</p>

			<p>Remember today's decisions are just a reflection of your current skill level. A year from now as your skill has grown, you'll have more options and a better sense of time management. But use patience, joy, and communication to pave the road to next year!</p>
