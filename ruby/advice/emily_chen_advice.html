			<h4>Learn your BASH keyboard shortcuts</h4>
			<p>You only need to memorize a few to make a noticeable difference. Ctrl-A, Ctrl-W, and Alt-. are a good start.</p>
		
			<h4>Read blogs</h4>
			<p>There is a ton of great material out there, and reading about why people prefer X vs Y will give you a greater understanding of what X and Y are in the first place.</p>
		</div>

			<h4>Step away if you need to</h4>
			<p>Sometimes you'll be working on the same problem for hours and you just can't figure out what the issue is. Take a breather and come back, often the distance will be enough to clear your head and see the problem in a new way!</p>
