			<h4>Set aside time for extra research!</h4>
			<p>The great thing about this program is it makes Ruby and Git fun.  There is a lot of information and some important things are just quickly mentioned. Set aside some time each night to do a little research on what you are studying.</p>

			<p>A simple google search is very helpful and you will probably find yourself often at a place called Stack Overflow.  This is also a good place to ask questions.</p>

			<h4>This advice is from Skillcrush but I like it so much it needs to be said again:</h4>
			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
