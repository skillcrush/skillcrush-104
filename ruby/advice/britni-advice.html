			<h4>Decide what you love and stop wasting time on what you don't!</h4>
			<p>I spent a lot of time trying to work with frameworks and languages I hated. Java is so clunky! I had resigned myself to a life of boaredom until I remembered how awesome and sexy Ruby was. Now that I am diving in head first to all things Ruby I've never been happier.</p>
