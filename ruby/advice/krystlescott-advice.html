			<h4>Don't Give Up!</h4>
			<p>This is so cliche, but you can't be quick to give up on your coding journey! There are going to be days when you pull your hair out trying to figure out some code. You'll want to run away screaming and believe that you can't do it. But you can! Walk away for a while if you must, but don't run away forever.</p>

			<p>Walking away from your computer once in a while is actually quite helpful and healthy. Don't throw your MacBook across the room when you can't understand how to position that div. Just take a deep breath, walk away for a while and do some other activities, then come back with a fresh mind. You'll find new clarity and energy to fix and understand your problems!</p>

			<h4>Don't Get Stuck!</h4>
			<p>There are SO many things to learn when it comes to the world of programming. With so many languages, frameworks, and ideas to understand, you may feel overwhelmed (but also excited) about all the things you feel you need to learn.</p>

			<p>Don't let this plethora of information paralyze you. Sometimes you will feel that there's so much to learn that you'll never learn it all. Well, you're right. And that's okay!!!</p>

			<p>Repeat after me: NO ONE KNOWS EVERYTHING. Even the most seasoned developers will tell you that they are still constantly learning every single day. It's okay to want to know various languages and processes, and I encourage you to study anything and everything! But DON'T let the information overload paralyze you. STUDY and CREATE! Python or Ruby, SASS or LESS, whatever it is, just learn it and DO IT!</p>
