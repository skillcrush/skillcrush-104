			<h2>When You Have a J.O.B.</h2>
			<p>Time at your J.O.B. is, of course, a must. For now at least, it pays the bills. While you get the training and education you need to pursue a different course for yourself, remember to give 100% to your J.O.B..  Dedication is rewarded and those rewards show up in all areas of your life! When you leave for the day, leave it behind! Don't let stray thoughts about work sabotage the rest of your time in the day, focus on one thing at a time!</p>

			<h2>Focus on Learning!</h2>
			<p>When you're not at your J.O.B., it's all about the process that gets you from where you are now to where you want to be...learning! It won't be easy, but it WILL produce results far greater than you imagine. Let go of the unproductive time-suckers, and use that 'found' time to devote to learning. Yes, watching tv was my first cut! Well, okay, I do still watch The Walking Dead with my son...we all have our 'quality of life' thresholds! ;D </p>

			<p>Some areas of your learning process will be much easier than others. Some topics you will breeze through, and others, not so much. Keep pushing thru, and remember that the only way you can fail is to give up! </p>

			<h2>You Can Do This!</h2>
			<p>Finding balance is elusive, and at times you will think that you're not being successful in any area of your life! Give yourself a break! Take a walk and enojy a cool spring evening. Fix a special dinner with your family.  Taking even a short break can help you re-focus and make your time spent on learning much more productive.</p>

			<p>I've learned that there's a difference between multi-tasking and compartmentalizing. Multi-tasking can be great, but it won't help you as much as putting all of your focus on one thing at a time. When you leave your J.O.B., shut that door and turn all of your attention to your next task. Family time- dinner, kids ready for bed, cleaning up the kitchen, whatever your home life looks like. All areas of your life are important and deserve to be a priorty. Section off your time and it will really reduce the guilty feeling that comes with doing 'this' but thinking you really should be doing 'that'.</p>

			<h2>What About 'Me' Time?</h2>
			<p>That's easy....investing in yourself by learning with Skillcrush, of course! ;D</p>
