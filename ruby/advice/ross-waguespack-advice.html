			<h4>Pick a language and keep at it</h4>
			<p>When I started to learn to code, I wanted to know everything right then and there. I keep jumping from HTML to CSS to JavaScript to Ruby to Ruby on Rails to Meteor and finally back to Ruby on Rails.  I wasted alot of time learning and forgeting and relearning.  Obviously HTML and CSS are very important as a foundation for Web Development but whichever route you chose to go after that stick with that all languages function the same way, just a diffrent syntax.</p>

			<h4>Find someone to do code reviews with.</h4>
			<p>At first I felt this was an impossible task as a newbie.  There are plenty of routes you can take.  Skillcrush is a great one.  As well as Code Newbies and joining one of their groups.  There are also sites like codewars and excersism.io that have you code and then talk about you code with others.</p>

			<h4>Write code</h4>
			<p>You have to constantly write code.  Just like learning anything else in life (a mucial instrument, or a new skill set at work) you have to practice what you are learning or your brain will not retain the new information.  Code ever chance you get.</p>
