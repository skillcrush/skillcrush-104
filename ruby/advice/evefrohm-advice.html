			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

			<h4>Getting over your Imposter Syndrome</h4>
			<p>The first rule of Imposter Syndrome Club is that you're not good enough to be in it. Imposter Syndrome, or Fraud Syndrome, is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments. Many new programmers tend to fall into the Imposter Syndrome state of mind when they first start out. They may say to themselves, “What are you doing here? What do you think you’re doing? You’re going to be found out!"</p>

			<p>Overcoming Imposter Syndrome requires self-acceptance:  you're code is never going to be perfet when you're first starting out. You don’t have to attain perfection or mastery to be worthy of the success you’ve achieved or any milestones you've hit along the way.</p>
			
			<p>It’s not about lowering the bar, it’s about resetting it to a realistic level that doesn’t leave you forever striving and feeling inadequate. You don’t have to be Linus Torvalds to be a valuable asset to your team and to those around you.  Nor do you have to attain perfection to share your code with the world.</p>
