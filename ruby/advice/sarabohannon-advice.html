			<h4>Notice the details, but don't get lost in them</h4>
			<p>The fine details are super important when it comes to coding and avoiding future nightmares.

			However, precious learning time can be lost if you allow yourself to get hung up on details of relative unimportance.
			Focus on seeing the big picture and the details will come back to you or you can tap into resources you've saved along the way.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>Repetition equals talent</h4>
			<p>You won't develop a talent or skill if you don't repeat it. You won't repeat something unless you are motivated to. You won't be motivated unless you have a natural desire or see an urgent necessity.</p>

			<p>Find your motivation and discover your true skills and talent.</p>
