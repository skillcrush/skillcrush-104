			<h4>Breathe, Learn ruby, and Love Google</h4>
			<p>Luckily for all of us ruby has a community that is as loyal as Apple customers and as a productive as Starbucks customers. The amount of information on the web about ruby is multiplying daily! So when you reach the inevitable impasse just google it and search 4 or 5 different ways to make it sure you've exhausted your research.</p>

			<p>Don't be afraid to push yourself either, test out crazy things. Get Funky! Bust a move and code up a storm. Make rrors and fix them. Like that dude Journey once said 'Don't stop believing.'</p>

			<h4>Above All</h4>
			<p>Keep your head down and keep moving...a rolling stone gathers no moss.</p>
