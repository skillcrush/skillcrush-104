			<h4>Take your time and practice</h4>
			<p>Learning how to code is hard but you can do it. Take your time and read your lessons, watch the videos, and print the transcripts. Reread/rewatch everything as many times as you need to. </p>

			<p>Try to practice everyday but, don't go overboard. Make sure you take breaks to clear your mind. It helps to get up and walk away for a while and then come back with a fresh outlook on what you are doing. Even if you have to leave it overnight, walk away. Maybe something will come to you while you sleep. Or in my case while I'm trying to get to sleep, keep pen and paper next to your bed or use your memo app on your phone to write it down. Otherwise you will forget!</p>

			<h4>Ask for help</h4>
			<p>Ask your classmates for help when you get stuck. Go to StackExchange and ask for help. Use Google. Look at what other people have done. The more you read code the more you start to understand.</p>

			<p>Use those errors too! Even if you have to copy the code solution you will make errors. Those errors can help you understand what the code is doing. </p>
