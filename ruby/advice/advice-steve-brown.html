			<h2>Don't drink and code!</h2>
			<p>Just kidding. Coding is totally more productive when you are looped!</p>

			<p>Actually, I'm only half kidding. Coding is easier when you just jump in and give it a go, even when you really don't have a solid idea of what you are doing. Approach your coding as if you are as uninhibited as being looped. Your code may not work, but at least you attempted to write something, which is much better than staring at your code editor's blank screen. In the famous words of Nike advertising, "Just do it!"</p>
