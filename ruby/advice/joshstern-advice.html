			<h4>People can only tell you what worked for themselves</h4>
			<p>They can't necessarily tell you what will work for you because they are not you. I'm not saying to ignore other people's advice. I'm saying that I've found the most helpful advice to be that which comes with an understanding of its underlying assumptions and reasoning.</p>

			<p>People often have a hard time understanding when you don't take their advice literally. A recent study found that people who feel expert at something tend to be less open to new ideas than people who feel naive. So be prepared for people to challenge you when you decide to take the road less traveled.</p>

			<h4>Robots might take all of our jobs</h4>
			<p>Then again, they might not. But if the robots run on Ruby, then you are in good shape.</p>

			<p>According to Ted Koppel, a cyberattack on the United States' electrical grid is very probable within the next several years. This is not just some brownouts, we're talking huges areas without power for months. He advises storing several months of food and water.</p>

			<p>In this scenario, robots may not be helpful.</p>
