	<h2>Hi I'm Emily Jo, and I have some advice for you!</h2></header>

		<section> <div class="advice"> 
		
		<h3>Mistakes, backtracking, and stalling out are <strong><em>good signs</em></strong></h3> 
		
			<p>Redefine these words for yourself right now: failure and progress. 
			Movement of all kinds is progress: forward, back, 
			up, down, in and out of understanding. Every maneuver is a chance
			to learn so don't get stuck in a self pitying rut when things
			aren't going your way - just keep <strong>moving</strong>! 
						
		<h3>Be stubborn, but don't be a masochist</h3>
		
			<p>It's important to mobilize some grit because you <em>will</em> run
			into a concept or a bug in your code that <em>will</em> send you through
			the wringer. An adamant refusal to admit defeat will push you to 
			untangling your problem, but don't force yourself to work through
			this all in one sitting.</p>
			
			<p>Change your scenery, get a cup of tea, focus your mind on another 
			task or thought completely. A fresh perspective often helps us 
			to see what was hiding in front of us all along.</p>
			
		<h3>Drop the stopwatch, this isn't a race</h3>
		
			<p>Whether you've been learning and writing code for years or minutes,
			don't take the joy out of it by putting a timestamp on it. Watching
			the clock is an unnecessary pressure, <em>especially</em> when you're 
			first learning. Take your time! Speed and efficiency will be a product 
			of patience and diligence; you might as well enjoy the journey.</p>
