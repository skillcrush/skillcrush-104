				<li><h4>Read everything, everywhere!</h4></li>
					<p>When you first start, you're not going to understand the majority of what you see. But getting used to the "tech speak" terms, and the general way poeople interact is what you're hoping for.  The code understanding will come and pretty soon you'll be contributing to stackoverflow, not just reading!</p>
		
				<li><h4>Practice, practice, practice</h4></li>
					<p>Think of 15 ideas for cool things you'd like to do, and just practice them. Once you get one working, tweak it until it's pretty, then tweak it again until the code is concise. Then try something new. Pretty soon you'll have a cool little bundle of small projects that really show your development over time.</p>

				<li><h4>Ask the dumb questions</h4></li>
					<p>Eventually you'll run into a project that no matter what you do, drives you into the hair-tearing-out, throwing things stage. So ask for help! It's not like you failed, it's like you're working on a real development team and you're having an outsider review your code. Sometimes being too close is the problem. And don't hold onto your supposed "failure". Fix the code and move on.</p>
