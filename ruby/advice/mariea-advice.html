			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>No matter how frustrated you get, stick with it; it will be worth it, if it is something that you truly enjoy and want to do</p>

			<h4>Resources are never ending</h4>
			<p>Google is the best, by far, for any question you may have. You aren't alone and you aren't the first to ask, so go out there and find it!</p>
