		<h1>Hi, my name is Dayis, and do I have some advice for you!</h1>

			<h4>Mistakes are the best teacher!</h4>
			<p>Attempting to learn something new, after being considered an "expert" in a different field is an uncomfortable position to be in to say the least. I had to repeat the advice I would give to new employees to myself:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It's going to take several months before this will begin to click for you.</li>
					<li>Don't be afraid to mess up. You'll learn the most from those experiences.</li>
					<li>And...there are no stupid questions. Usually those with inquiring minds will learn and gain confidence the fastest.
				</ul>

			<h4>So...do not be afraid. You can do this!</h4>
			<p>Skillcrush will not make you an expert, but it does open the door to a new skillset. You'll have to determine how to best utilize it.</p>

			<p>Will you dive deeper and find (or create) some small projects to gain confidence and make your way to a freelance extrordinaire? Will you utilize this base knowledge to better interact with your technical collegues...impress your boss and get a raise? </p>

			<p>There's no "right answer" to how you allow this to change your life. You've already took the hardest step by getting started.</p>
