			<h4>Programming Is Fun!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming it's exciting! It's challenging and fun! And it's an opportunity to learn something new that a lot of people just don't understand.</p>

			<p>It can also be a bit aggravating and frustrating at times. But if you persist and manage to figure out whatever the problem is, it is such a satisfying feeeling of accomplishment!</p>

			<h4>Practice! Practice! Practice!</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, like writing code, you need to just keep practicing! I am continually, (possibly, addictively) tweaking various new code-y things I have learned to see 'what happens if I do this?' or 'what happens if I do that?' </p>
			<p>Trial and error is a great way to learn how things work.
