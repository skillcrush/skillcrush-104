			<h2>Utilize Free Resources</h2>
			<p>If you are just beginning, there are a number of free online resources to get your feet wet. Code Academy, W3Schools, Kahn Academy Ruby Monk, the list goes on and one. Try a lesson out on any of these resources to see which format works best for you</p>

			
			<h2>Project Based Learning</h2>
			<p>Make something. Give yourself a simple project to complete, such as a single web page. Doing one thing from start to finish will help you to see how the pieces come together. </p>

			
			<h2>Don't Learn It All, Learn Where To Find It All</h2>
			<p>Don't expect yourself to remember everything. Have faith in knowing that the answer to everything is at your fingertips. Utilize sites like stack overflow to help yourself find the answers you're looking for.</p>
