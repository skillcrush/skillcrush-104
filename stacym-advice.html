			<h4>Frustration is inevitable.</h4>
			<p>Learn to like it because being stuck when learning to code or simply learning something that you haven't learned YET is vital to the process of learning it!</p>

			<p>Learn to change your reaction to feeling lost. Instead of letting fear or even embarassment take over, tell those characters to take a seat. You are on a journey and they're not welcome. It's ok to enjoy being in the woods - you'll discover all kinds of things if you look around instead of panicing and only fixating on finding the way out.</p>
