		<h1>Hi, my name is Steve and I have some <br> practical advice for you!</h1>
	</header>

		<main>

			<h2>CONFUSION IS NECESSARY as stated in the course exercise !</h2>

			<p>Remember researching and retrying are essential to coding. Be persistant and keep trying to tackle the challenges. Do not give up or be discouraged.</p>

			<p>Go back and review coursse materials that covers the source of your confusion. Also. Google and do some research to get information on the challenge. This is what developers do. Also, developers are a source of problem resolution, so problems and confusion is the right place to be as a developer. As stated in the original text "It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h2>Suspended Discouragement!</h2>

			<p>As many have said, when it comes to confusion its time to resolve through research and through the help of others. Teamwork is critical and that starts now with the student community and instructor sessions. </p>

			<p>You do not know it all, and sharing our skills through collaboration with our team-mates helps fill in those VOIDS WE ALL HAVE.</p>

			<h2> Stay Organized!</h2>

			<p>Take good notes and review the Skillcrush transcripts. What seems easy at first is easily forgotten and not all steps are itterated in subsequent instructions.</p>

			<p>Organizatiuon is critical to researching a challenge and helps you build functional resources. Again, this is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.It is through this process that you will learn to conduct your own research through Googke or other domains, and build a wealth of resources. </p>
