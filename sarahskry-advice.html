			<h4>Don't be so hard on yourself!</h4>

			<p>Mistakes happen. You're learning a new language and a new skill and so mistakes are a part of the process. You'll make a mistake and remember or learn something that will make you better next time.</p>

			<p>In fact, in code, mistakes are inevitable, unavoidable and will recurring. Mistakes are necessary. If you aren't making them something isn't right. Sometimes you will do everything right and something will still go wrong and it's suppose to. It's the nature of the work. So don't beat yourself up about them. Take one mistake at a time, one day at a time.</p>

			<p>Do yourself a favour and take on a mantra. One deep breath and on to the next.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>

			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
