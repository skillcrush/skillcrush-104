			<h4>Wear sunscreen.</h4>
			<p>Just do it, especially if you have tattoos.</p>

			<h4>Stick to one topic / language / book and see it through.</h4>
			<p>None of this jumping around business...keep pushing through, even
			if you get stuck or feel confused.</p>

			<h4>Celebrate your successes</h4>
			<p>Learning to program is a challenge; when you've made strides, acknowledge them!
			Remember, Rome was not built in a day.</p>

			<h4>Find a programming partner and work towards a common goal</h4>
			<p>Strength in numbers...plus, having a pal to ride the programming struggle bus
			with makes the ride less bad.</p>
