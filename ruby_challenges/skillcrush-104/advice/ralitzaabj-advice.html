			<h4>When you hit a dead end, take a break!</h4>
			<p>This is a piece of advice that I have been given time and time again, and yet it is so useful that I felt I needed to repeat it here.</p>

			<p>On many occasions, I have struggled over a problem, reaching the proverbial “dead end”, but refusing to quit because I have felt as if “I almost had the answer.”  However, the longer I persisted in “hitting my head against the wall” the more my frustration grew, significantly reducing my ability to think clearly. </p>

			<p>Eventually, either because of exhaustion, or because my husband dragged me away from the computer, I would take a break. And after an hour or two (or maybe a short nap), I would come back to the problem, and nine times out of ten find the solution within a few minutes. So, I think this is one of the best pieces of advice - when you hit a dead end, take a break.</p>
