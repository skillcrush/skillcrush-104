			<h4>Take a breath</h4>
			<p id="leftcol">There will be a point (more than one!) where what you're doing has you fuming and ready to tear out your hair.  That's a good point to walk away and take a few breaths.  It's natural, it's normal, and it happens to everyone.</p>

		<section class="wrapper2">
			<h4>Don't be intimidated</h4>
			<p id="midcol">Many people treat "computers" like a collection of great mythical secrets; it doesn't have to be that way!  Take it step by step and forget what you know as an adult; try to learn like you did when you were younger and didn't know any better.  Do it, then do it again.  Do it over and over.  Sometimes follow the instructions; sometimes don't, just to see what happens, but always keep moving forward! </p>
		</section>
		<section class="wrapper3">
			<h4>Always keep moving forward!</h4>
			<p id="rightcol">Way important is the Dori principle: "Just keep swimming!"  Always make progress, even minor progress.  Having trouble with your main class or functionality?  Great, it happens; move on to something smaller that you know you can do, so you can get your groove back!</p>
