			<h4>Confusion is normal!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming, you will be exploring new territory. It's thrilling creating something out of nothing, but there will be plenty of hiccups and stumbling blocks along the way. It really is a lot like learning a new language...and trying to write a book in that language at the same time!</p>

			<p>Confusion is obviously going to be part of the learning process. Don't beat yourself up if you don't get it the first time. Keep asking questions and searching for answers. Take breaks. Come back to the problem again the next day. Often, possible solutions occured to me first thing when I woke up! And remember, google is your friend!</p>
