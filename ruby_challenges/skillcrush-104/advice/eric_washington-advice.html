			<h3>Pick a Language</h3>
			<p>After you pick a language, learn everything you can about that language. By the end of your self-taught learning you should be close to an expert in that language. Things may seem extremley confusing at first but you cant let that deter you.</p>

			<h3>Build, Build, Build</h3>
			<p>This is probably the most important tip that I can give you. Building small projects will not only help you with mastering the language, but it will also give you projects that you can showcase to futurue employers.</p>

			<h3>Enjoy the "Journey"</h3>
			<p>Learning how to code is going to be one of the most challenging and and enjoyable experiences that you will go through in your life. You can learn a lot of valuable life lessons from learning how to cdoe.</p>
