			<h4>Practice Isn't Perfect</h4>
			<p>Though I know that practice makes perfect, sometimes the idea of perfect keeps me from the point of practice: learning new skills.  Don't let the details keep you from moving forward.</p>

			<p>Write code often and with abandon.</p>

			<h4>Bookmark Your Roadblocks</h4>
			<p>If you really hit a roadblock, bookmark it temporarily and move on to something else.  If it's a real doozy, drop some questions in a forum, and then step back.</p>

			<p>Working on another part of your project can give you a sense of accomplishment and remind you that you have skills!</p>

			<p>With some fresh eyes and boosted morale, return to see what more you can tackle.  Bit by bit, you'll get there.</p>
