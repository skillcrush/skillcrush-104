			<h4>Confusion should be used as a motivator!</h4>
			<p>Most of us have not done much in this realm of programming. This is all new to us. So if you are not confused, maybe you should consider moving beyond this. Otherwise, remember that learning to code is a lot like a baby learning to walk.</p>



			<p>Like a baby... </p><img src="https://unsplash.com/photos/JZwb0Rc2vMA/download" alt="adult and child"/><p>You get yourself up and moving then all of a sudden you come crashing down. Confused and a little mad... you look around in desperation. Then you pull yourself together, after a little encouragement, you pull yourself up and try again! Then once you have the basics down, you realize there are so many new things that you still have to learn! No worries! Soon you and me will become totally capable of standing on our own two feet while doing all kinds of amazing things in the coding world!</p>

			<h4>Google it! That's what developers do!</h4>
			<p>Programming is such a fast-changing field. A senior developer may have a master's degree in computer science and has been working in his job for 20 years, but if he doesn't work with all the latest changes in coding, he will be lost. Even senior developers need help occassionally!</p>

			<p>Don't be afraid to ask for help but google it first! Most likely, the question has been asked before!</p>
