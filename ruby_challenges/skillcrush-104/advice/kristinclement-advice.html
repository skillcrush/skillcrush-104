			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>You are learning a new skill.  Good for you!  <a href="http://i.imgur.com/66UImi1.gif" Just remember that you do not need to learn everything all at once</a>.  Learning in smaller sessions is less overwhelming.  Take a break whenever you feel frustration taking over your brain.  The lesson will still be there while you go outside and get some fresh air.</p>

			<p>If you get stuck on a particular concept, researching it online is a great option.  Another option is to ask for help, whether that be a fellow classmate or at a <a href= "http://www.meetup.com/Rails-Girls-Atlanta/" local meetup</a>.  Someone else may have the same question.</p>

			<p>Practice makes perfect!  Make the time to practice your coding skills everyday.  And soon that habit will kick off a <a href="http://i.giphy.com/LJ0kTsl2WvHQk.gif" new career</a>!</p>
