			<h4>Don't psych yourself out!</h4>
			<p>Something called "imposter syndrome" is very real, and will happen to you. Don't let it get the best of you. You can totally do this, it doesn't take a special super human kind of person to master this. You are already well on your way.</p>

			<p>Use that moment, that moment of doubt, to fuel yourself. Fight against it, prove to yourself that you can totally do this.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
