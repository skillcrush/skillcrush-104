			<h4>Making mistakes is how you learn!</h4>
			<p>It's easy to copy and paste example code and get your new script to run first time; but have you really learnt anything? Always have a go at completing a challenge from scratch first of all.  Run and re-run and welcome any error messages that you encounter along the way</p>

			<p>Error messages are you friend, don't think of them as marks of failure but as guidance on where and how to improve your code.  The more you see the quicker you'll recognise similar issues in the future and eventually learn how to do things right first time!</p>

			<h4>How do you eat an elephant?  Well, one bite at a time of course!</h4>
			<p>Learning anything new can seem daunting, especially something as complex as a new programming language.</p>

			<p>However, in the same way that a baby learns to talk (or walk), start one step at a time.  Break your coding challenge down into small tasks, get one bit working, then the next, then the next...</p>

			<p>Before you know it you'll be doing the coding equivalent of that baby reading a story aloud or running around a track and the process of getting there will be worth it</p>
