			<h4>Keep your brain young by learning new skills!</h4>
			<p>Learning new skills at any age creates new brain synapses, your brain grows and you get smarter! The older you are the harder it gets, but constantly learning new skills keeps your brain sharp...and it gets easier with practice.</p>

			<h4>Any new language is difficult at first.</h4>
			<p>I've "learned" a few other programming languages, but never really used them. Ruby is by far the easist language! It has real words that make sense: push, pull, clone.</p>

			<p>We also have the amazing benefit of lots of code, already stressed over, that is available to anyone...for free! How sweet is that? Someone else did the hard work and I get to incorporate it into my code.</p>

			<p>Learning anything new takes time, practice and perserverance. If you can't figure something out, don't keep circling; walk away and do something entirely different. Our brains are amazing. They keep working on a problem even when we aren't consciously thinking about it. You'll be surprised how much clearer your thinking is when you return to the problem.</p>
