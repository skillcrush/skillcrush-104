			<h4>Embrace the error</h4>
			<p>Basically, read the whole error message and try to understand it. Straight up. Don't just sit there and feel like a failure when it doesn't work the first time, when you see the word "error" followed by a million sentences. Really try to understand what went wrong and use that message to solve your problem. You got this.</p>

      <h4>Take your own advice</h4>
      <p>I'm sure we're all writing beautiful pieces of advice for each other that we don't always follow. For example, in the above scenario, I dread error messages and I let them discourage me. I'm advising me, and you, to follow our own suggestions because we are often those that can pinpoint our weaknesses and can recognize how best to work on them.</p>
