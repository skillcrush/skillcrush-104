		<h3>Hello darling. If you're looking for a little light on your /path, you're in the right place.</h3>
		<h1>Christie's Top 3 Tips For Ruby Rookies</h1>

			<h2>#1 Use your resources!</h2>
			<p>The amazingly fantastic Skillcrush team has assembled a full stack of super helpful cheatsheets on all the essential topics. Think of them collectively as your recipe book for coding awesome sauce.</p>

			<p>You will encounter errors at some point. Don't despair. Look first to the cheatsheets, because chances are really good the answer lies within those pages. If you do not find the solution there, get thee to the <a href="https://mightybell.com" target="_blank">MightyBell</a> and read (really read!) what your mates have asked and commented about the challenge. The law of averages says someone else has felt your pain - and overcome it!</p>

			<h2>#2 Use your noodle!</h2>
			<p>Usually the right solution requires a little mental elbow grease. You will need to think through the problem you're trying to solve. It's highly probably you may try a few scripts that fail to run before you hit the one that works. Be patient and persevere!</p>

			<p>If coding were just all copy and paste, we'd have gymnasiums full of chimps pumping out gems like Harry Winston.</p>
			
			<h2>#3 Use the Force!</h2>
			<p>Aka, the Google. If you've thought and thought like an owl (because all owls think a lot), consulted your cheatsheets, and still come up with nil, crowdsource a solution with a simple search. Between <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a>, and a google different blogs, you're bound to run smack bang into the answer which you seek.</p>
		    
			<p>Just remember, like a good Jedi, to "always pass on what you have learned."</p>
		
		<h3> I don't want to 'string' it out, so there you have it, Rubkies. Your short and sweet daily affirmations to git you through the early assignments. Good luck and good speed.</h3>
