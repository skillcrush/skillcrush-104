			<h4>There are many ways to do the same thing!</h4>
			<p>This lovely discovery came to me while doing an assignment and realizing I didn't understand how the F I was supposed to do what I was supposed to do, the way I was being told to do it! Luckily, I eventually saw the light, but in the meantime, I noticed (thanks to lots and lots of Google searches) that, much like what all my math teachers always told me, it doesn't matter HOW you get the answer; rather, just that you arrive at the answer correctly! ... Some methods are easier than others, and being that I am lazy (I like to call it 'efficient,' though), I prefer those.</p>

			<h4>Let's get physical!</h4>
			<p>As it turns out, staring at a computer screen and typing for hours on end is actually quite bad for your eyes and wrists. And neck. And back. And shoulders. And posture. And... Okay, you get the point. But seriously, sometimes I have been sitting in the same position for hours and then at some point I will actually blink, and consequently notice that my vision is all blurry. I also have to wear a wrist brace at times while typing (hopefully that is not an early indication of arthritis, but my gut tells me it is).</p>

			<p>Being that I think good health is very important (and that I value my eyesight), I would recommend getting up to take breaks often, and stretching as well, while working on code for long periods of time. Not only will your body thank you for it later, but it may help clear your head if you are stuck on something as well, and when you get back to it, maybe you will see exactly what you were missing all along. And that brings me to my final word of advice...</p>

			<h4>Quit.</h4>
			<p>... Just kidding! Quit, but only temporarily, and only if you are really super stuck on something and it's driving you insane and you are getting angry. I have called it quits at times, only to come back the next day with a fresh start and finding my issue immediately!</p>
