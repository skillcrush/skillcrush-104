			<h4>Search for Alternate Explanations&#33;</h4>
			<p>If you're new to coding, expect broken code frequently. Oftentimes, your code and process are perfect if not for a simple syntax error... a missing colon or quotation mark, for example.</p>

			<p>However, just as often, your code or process are simply incorrect. You've misunderstood the instructions or added steps out of order and cannot spot what's wrong. With Google, and descriptive search terms, you'll likely find the solution at forums or blogs explained using language or examples that clarify the process.</p>

			<h4>Find and Save the BEST References&#33;</h4>
			<p>When fixing code, you'll Google frequently to find solutions and occasionally find that "one source" that seems to explain your dilemma in just the right way. Some of the best resources are others who struggled at the start and now post their version of explaining code.</p>

			<p>If the perfect solution is found on a site that appears to "speak your language", save that reference! Bookmark it. Create a spreadsheet. Whatever works for you.</p>

			<p>Most likely, that random source you stumbled onto will offer future solutions to other code dilemmas written in a way (or using examples) that will be similarly easy for YOU to understand. Save yourself time and check out that site first nest time.</p>
