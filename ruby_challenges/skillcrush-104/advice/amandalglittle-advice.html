			<h4>Don't Be Afraid to Try New Things</h4>
			<p>There are so many great resources, like Skillcrush, to help you learn how to program. When you feel like you have a good handle on a something like html or ruby don't be afraid to experiment and try new things.
			 Even if you mess up it is all part of the learning process and it can only help you improve your skills.</p>
			
			<h4>Clear Your Head</h4>
			<p>Sometimes certain concepts and skills will come easy to you, and sometimes they won't. If you are really stuck on a problem or issue, take a break or start working on something else to clear your head. Sometimes simply stepping away from the problem for a few minutes can give you some clarity when you come back to it.
			Just remember that everyone gets stuck at one point or another and there is always a solution out there.</p>
			
			<h4>Stackoverflow</h4>
			<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> is an amazing website where you can find the answer to almost any problem. You should definitely use this resource.</p>
