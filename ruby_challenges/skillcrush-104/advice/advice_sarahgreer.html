			<h4 class="sarahgreer-advice">Coding is easy, but there is a catch</h4>
			<p class="sarahgreer-advice">You have probably heard that learning to code is easy.  Not only is this true, but it's also fun and addictive.  Your first couple of lessons will give you confidence and you will want know more. But here's the catch -- it doesn't stay easy.  You will reach a point where you are getting errors and feeling very frustrated.  Sometimes you will look at a project and think, "I don't even know where to start."  The hard part is making the decision to keep moving forward or to quit, and you will have to make it over and over.</p> 
                
            <p class="sarahgreer-advice">Don't get caught up in decision.  If you push through the difficulties you will have learned valuable skills, not only in coding, but in all aspects of your life.</p>
		
			<h4 class="sarahgreer-advice">Find a community</h4>
			<p class="sarahgreer-advice">You've probably heard about Code Academy and other online educational coding sites.  They are awesome.  There are also hundreds of books available through library systems.  And I bet there is even a meetup or two in your area.  There are many ways to learn to code for free and without ever having to leave your house, but you need a community.  You need a place to go when you have questions.  You need a place to brag when you figure it out.  You will want to help others when you see them struggling.</p>
            
            <p class="sarahgreer-advice">I think learning to code is really only about two things:  finding your community and always moving forward when you get stuck.</p>
