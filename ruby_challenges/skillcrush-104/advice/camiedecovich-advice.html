			<h4>Don't Panic!</h4>
			<p>When something doesn't work, don't panic. And, don't go crazy changing things, unless you are super confident you know where the problem resides. Take it slow and steady. Read the error logs. Repeat your steps. Most often, there is a mispelling, a missing character, or some other mis-type. </p>

			<h4>Repeat. Redo. Recycle.</h4>
			<p>When you delve into an exercise or task. Read over the lesson or requirements. Really orient your brain on the subject. Perform the work. Cycle back through the lesson or requirements to ensure the expected outcome has been satisfied.</p>
