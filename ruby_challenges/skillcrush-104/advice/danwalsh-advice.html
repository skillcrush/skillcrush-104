			<h4>You'll be granddddd</h4>
			<p>HTML & CSS seem pretty straightforward to begin with, once you've studied them a bit... JavaScript ramps things up a notch - a <bold>big</bold> notch - you won't have a clue what's going on for a while.</p>

			<p>Just keep at it - you'll get it, I promise.</p>

			<h4>Believe me.</h4>
			<p>Honestly, it might seem overwhelming, but the satisfaction you get when you write your FizzBuzz and get it to work is class.</p>

			<p>You can do it lads - enjoy it.</p>
