			<h4>When you feel like you've hit a wall with your code, take a break!</h4>
			<p>You can bruteforce some coding problems by hunkering down and working on possible solutions for hours, but other times it's just best to step back and do something else, even if it's just for fifteen minutes. The more agitated you are in not finding something that works, the harder it will be for you to think straight. So, clear your mind for a bit, and come back with a fresh perspective.</p>

			<h4>Feeling demotivated? Open up your favorite music streaming service and get into the groove.</h4>
			<p>There will be days where you just don't want to code. When you need that extra push, bring up your favorite Spotify playlist, start that motivational Songza mood list, or use whatever other music service you prefer.</p>
