			<h4>Google will be your friend...</h4>
			<p>No matter how experienced a developer you are, you just can't know everything. As a result, you will have to resort to using Google to help you solve your problem from time to time...and more often than not you will find yourself on Stackoverflow reading a resolution to your problem...</p>

			<h4>Practice makes perfect!</h4>
			<p>When it comes to programming skills, it is very much a case of "use it, or lose it" - you need to practice as much as you can.....</p>

			<p>This practice could take many forms, be it coding katas, personal projects, following tutorials, implementing code snippets from magazine articles or blog postings you just need to get on and do it in order to keep your skills sharp and up to date.</p>
