			<h1>Hi! My name is Luke Wood, and I have some advice for you!</h1>
		</header>

			<div class="advice">
				<h2>Oh the things I wish I'd known three months ago!</h2>

				<p>When you do something you've never done before, and try your hand at it every day for hours, for months at a time, you start to notice parts of yourself that need improvement. Sometimes these are things that you've never really noticed before.</p>

				<p>With me, small issues became big ones very quickly.  Little ticks about myself that I brushed off (things like skimming over new reading material which made me miss so many important details, procrastinating, and giving up too early) were actually making the learning process longer and harder (tehe).</p>
 
				<p>That being said, being given advice by someone else and learning it for yourself (the hard way) are two completely different things.  People seem inclined to ignore advice from others too often, but get frustrated when theirs is ignored.</p>

				<p>So giving your present and future self advice, from your past self, is the way to go; And my advice (to myself) is this:</p>		
					<ul>
					<li>Slow down.</li>
					<li>Read EVERY WORD.</li>
					<li>Get enough sleep.</li>
					<li>Take time off to reflect, and for your learning to sink in.</li>
					<li>Don't cram.</li> 
					<li>Take time to freestyle, don't just do exercises.</li>
					<li>Get enough sleep</li>
					<li>Most importantly, don't be afraid to fail, or to pursue something that no-one else sees or believes in.</li> 
					</ul>
