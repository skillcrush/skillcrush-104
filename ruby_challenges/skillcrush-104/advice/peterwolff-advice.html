      <h4>Google is Great!</h4>
      <p>The great thing about programming and the problems that you run into along the way? Many other people have run into the same issues as well! A quick google search and you're find forum posts and discussions with people talking about problems and solutions that they've come across.</p>

      <h4>Documentation is amazing!</h4>
      <p>We've seen how helpful documenting your own code can be, but reading through the official ruby documentation can also be very beneficial. There's a ton of great code examples and a lot of great info on important methods. </p>

      <h4>Run checks and tests constantly!</h4>
      <p>It's really easy to use puts to see what the value of your variables are at all times. Adding a check to your code is really easy to do and can give you very valuable info on how your code is working if you're running into any issues.</p>
