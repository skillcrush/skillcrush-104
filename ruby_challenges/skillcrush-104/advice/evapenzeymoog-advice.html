		<h1>Hi my name is Eva. My advice is to set aside more time than you think you will need to get through your classwork. I for one definitely can't learn properly if I feel rushed or stressed - and unlike a lot of "learning" that goes on in traditional schools, this isn't about just being able to get through an assignement and turn it in for a grade or knowing enough to do well on a test. You really need to be committed to learning the content, which takes time and mental focus. So make sure you've set aside ample time, closed out all your other tabs, put your phone in a different room, and done whatever it is that will allow your specific brain to learn fully.</h1>

			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
