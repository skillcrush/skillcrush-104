			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>It is all a process. whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening. Your knowlege of what your reading is getting better, Your so close.</p>
