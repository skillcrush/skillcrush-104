			<h4>You Must Fail to Succeed</h4>
			<p>I've learned more from figuring out why my code doesn't work than when it does. Backtracking and reviewing your code is the only way to learn.</p>

			<h4>Small Mistakes Can Have Major Consequences</h4>

			<p>No exaggeration; I've spent HOURS trying to figure out why an application wouldn't work. Sometimes is was a mispelling, other times I missed an important piece of punctuation.</p>

			<h4>Why Does Any of That Matter?</h4>

			<p>Computers are stupid! Although we (society) have ascribed human qualities to computers (i.e. comparing it to a human brain), computers are extraordinarily literal; they do not have the ability to make inferences and understand shades of gray. That's why when you type a comma rather than a period, it "reads" it as a catastrophic error. Unlike a human, it doesn't assume that it's a human error (a typo) but still understand what the author intended. Coding hones your attention to detail!</p>

			<h4>Embrace Frustration</h4>

			<p>Coding is not difficult, just frustrating (which is a good thing). Through this process, I've learned that coding is not a mystical process.  With time and effort, everyone can learn to code.</p>
