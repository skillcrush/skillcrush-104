			<h4>Try not to get too competitive</h4>
			<p>I always hate it when I feel like I'm behind, and everyone already knows twenty different programming and development languages, while I'm still struggling to get understand two or three. There will always people that know more, and always peole that know less. Be a student and a teacher. </p>
			

			<h4>Try not to get overwhelmed</h4>
			<p>There are so many frameworks, languages, trends, etc., always coming and going. You can't know them all. Try to pick a stack of a few and focus on those rather than trying to learn them all at once.</p>
