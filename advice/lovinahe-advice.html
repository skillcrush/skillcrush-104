			<h4>Asking questions are important!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming the first thing you have to remember is that this is completley new. There are tons of message boards, instructors, and other people that are learning this new skill. Never be afraid or embarrased to ask questions. You'll be so glad you did!</p>

			<p>Confusion is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>The small victories are to be celebrated!</h4>
			<p>Did you just change the color of your header in CSS, and it's showing up in your browser? Were you initially not seeing an image that you inserted in your div, but after some troubleshooting it's showing up? Pat yourself on the back! That's progress, and it should be celebrated!</p>

			<p>Just knowing that you've taken those steps towards the final product of your work is something to be proud of.</p>
