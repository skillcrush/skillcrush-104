			<h4>Practice practice practice!</h4>
			<p>I've been learning coding on and off for almost a year now. I started with free tutorials online like <a href="codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>then I took a HTML/CSS course at General Assembly, which gives me more knowledge on basic HTML/CSS. It was when I took a UX Design course from Bloc that further developed my coding skills. By the end of that bootcamp, I was comfortably coding my portfolio.</p>

			<p>After completing my portfolio, I stopped practicing writing codes and I somewhat forgot how to code! So I went back to Codecademy and refreshed my memory.</p>

			<p>So bottom line, is practice, practice and practice some more! I love writing codes, and there is still so much to learn and I think there will always be more to learn! Next step -  Javascript!</p>

			<h4>Github is your best friend</h4>
			<p>When I was first introduced to Git, I was like OMG HELP what is this!! Opening Terminal on my computer? WHAT! I am not exaggerating! What is command line?</p>

			<p>I was so scared to even do anything with it at first, I avoided using Git as much as I could but... how am I gonna share my work with mentor? Fast forward... Once you get used to git, it is like your best friend. with a few simple git add, git commit and git push, your local repo is on your remote repo where you can share with anyone and collaborate with them!</p>

			<p>Don't ever be scared when you hit a wall. There's always a solution on Google, someone is/was in the same situation and share their experience and solution. That's the beauty of technology!</p>
