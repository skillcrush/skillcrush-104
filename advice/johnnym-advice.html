			<h4>First of All, Don't Ever Get a Dog With Lots of Fur</h4>
			<p>Because then when you're home just trying to enjoy yourself by learning to code when the house is all quiet while everyone else is at work, the dog's fur will be freaking everywhere, causing you to have a mild anxiety attack, and it will probably bark at anything going on outside too because it's an effing collie. Terrible for trying to learn to code.</p>

			<h4>Green Tea is Way Better Than Coffee</h4>
			<p>Being wired is fun, but not to the point where I feel like I'm on the verge of having a heart attack and my legs are RLSing all over the place. Try a nice green tea instead; minimal caffeine, and a nice even concentration for when you want to put a fist through your monitor. Just like the zen masters do it.</p>

			<p>Also, pick up a copy of The Economist if you can. Good reading and a proper way to stay informed during lunch breaks.</p>
