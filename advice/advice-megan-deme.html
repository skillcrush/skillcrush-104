			<h4>Try to read through the lesson before following step by step</h4>
			<p>Specifically in the Responsive Web Devlopement Course, I was going to the next lesson and following step by step, imeediately. I trusted the previous lessons so I thought no lesson would be any different. While makng the Unplugged webiste I started to contrust the whole website in the third day. I struggled for two weeks and was completely behind. Once curiousity kicked in, I looked forward into the lesson and found out that I did not need to create the website all my own...I had instructions! So, it doens't hurt to see what's up a head, especially if you think it's odd that you're doing two weeks of work for one day challenge. </p>

			<h4>Ask Questioins if you think it's a computer problem</h4>
			<p>As I was git-ting started my terminal was not giving me the results I wanted. Like most, I spend a few hours GOOGLING! Totally, didn't need to do that. I took a chance and shared my issue with the Google Group. An Instructor got back to me in a pretty timely manner and I was fixed!</p>
