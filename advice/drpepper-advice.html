			<h4>Do not think this will be easy.</h4>
			<p>Coding can be a lot of fun. But in no way is it easy to understand. There are more than a few steps it takes to figure things out in the tech world.</p>

			<p>Once you understand something after much frustration is very cool. A smile breaks out and you're like, "Wow I did this. Go me!"</p>

			<h4>This will be frustrating.</h4>
			<p>The frustration coding has brought me is almost unbearable. It makes me want to give up almost everyday and go live on a remote kiwi farm in New Zealand. But I don't. Because I know I can learn and so can you. It just takes a lot of practice and...maybe a drink at the end of the day.</p>

			<p>Just think. If it was easy to do this for a living then everyone would do it!</p>

			<p>Always remember that there are all kinds of different programming. There's no telling what you'll be able to do once you find the right language and developing inspiration.</p>
