				<h3 style="font-family: impact;">STUDY RESEARCH 
				</h3>
			<p style="font-family: fantasy;">

				</p>
				
				<h3 style="font-family: impact;"> GIANT STEPS
				</h3>
			<p style="font-family: fantasy;">

			<h3 style="font-family: impact;">PUSH PULL COMMIT.</h3> 
			<p style="font-family: fantasy;">
			I can assure you its not manual labor, I hope. It is however labor. Laboring till you get it. Gems and commits, we are not speaking of relationships here.... are they?? Find out! </p>
