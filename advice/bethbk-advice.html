			<h4>Not sure I will ever get anywhere</h4>
			<p>I hope this counts as advice... I still feel like I am at the beginning of my journey! Even though I know HTML, CSS, now Git and a little bit of Javascript, it has taken almost two years and I still don't feel qualified to actually do much with them!</p>
			<p>OK, I'm going to give myself some advice that has helped me in the past: Just keep plugging. Make yourself sit down and learn every day and one day, you will be surprised at what you can do! The only way to get what you want is to keep going.</p>
			
			<h4>Don't give up.</h4>
			<p>So, for those just starting out, know that coding continues to feel overwhelming sometimes, even after you've learned a fair amount, because there is always more to learn! I guess feeling overwhelmed is sort of a good thing--the old "now I know what I don't know" adage.</p>
