			<h4>Try It On Your Own!</h4>
			<p>As I followed along with the videos and lessons and cheatsheets and quizzes some times it certainly felt that I had no idea if I was absorbing any of it!</p>

			<p>Each week I set my self up with a small (i.e. achievable) project to practice what I had just learned.</p>

			<h4>Most of the time I surprised myself!</h4>
			<p>I was able to handle most of the work from memory and while some things took a number of tries - and a few google searches - I got to where I needed to go.</p>

			<p>This confirmed for me that I was grasping the concepts and gave me the confidence to continue on with the next week's work!</p>

			<p><span>And then I took a break!</span></p>
