			<h4>Don't worry! I have some advice for you...</h4>
			<p>Learning how to code can seem like a daunting task. There are so many languages and resources; it can be confusing to figure out where to begin. I know that I did a ton of Googling which lead me from site to site and blog to message board to article and back around again. Luckily, there are a lot of resources which makes it easier to figure out where to start.</p>
      <p>I believe the first place to start is to understand your interest. Why do you want to learn to code? What do you want to code? Do you like design? Are you looking to make a career change or learn new skills to boost your current position? Do you want to work independently, freelance or be part of a team? Understanding the answers to these questions will help you figure out where to start. For example, if you love design and user experience, you should learn front-end web languages like HTML and CSS.</p>
      <p>Know that your goals can evolve as you begin. You may find that your initial interest in programming may move to something else. I strongly suggest that you set some goals and ask for help to stay accountable. Coding can be hard. I will put off doing assignments unless I have timelines, etc.</p>
      <p>You can do this! Learning to code is not easy but it's interesting and it's an in-demand skill.</p>
