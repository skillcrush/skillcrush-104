			<h1>From one newbie to anotherâ€¦</h1>
			<h4>Surround yourself with supportive and awesome people</h4>
			<p> Don't go at anything alone. Even if you don't have large community of fellow code queens at your disposal, make sure to have people close to you cheering you on.</p>

			<h4>Lean into the difficulty</h4>
			<p>If it were easy, everyone would be doing it. You're already here and clearly possess the grit to get after it. Keep plugging away and enjoy the challenge.
			</p>

			<h4>Stay hungry</h4>
			<p>Do whatever you can to keep your curiosity. Do passion projects. Figure out how to make ideas realities. </p>
