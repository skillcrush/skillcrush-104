			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>Do not fear confusion. When learning something new this feeling will always engulf you and make you think you can't do it. Don't be scared, you will get through this.</P>

			<h4>Ask for help!</h4>
			<p>It's the only way you will sometimes be able to understand things. There will be someone who explains a concept in a way that it will finally will be clear to you and you will have that "AHA!" moment.</p>

			<h4>Practice makes perfect...</h4>
			<p class="no-border">Ok, maybe it won't make you perfect, but it will sure help you get familiarized with the process and in turn help you figure out so many of the bumps you run into on this journey. Sometimes while trying to solve one problem you will figure out how to solve another one you've been struggling with. And that my friends is why practicing your code is a good idea.</p>
