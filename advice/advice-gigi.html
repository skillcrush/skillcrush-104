			<h4>Confusion is your friend..</h4>
			<p>When I first started learning to code, confusion was a great thing! Well besides being confused, I was also determined to fix and answer my own question to what I was confused about.</p>

			<p>I made lots of mistakes and although I asked for help, I was able to answer these questions on my own while I waited for an actual answer.</p>

			<h4>Don't get distracted and discouraged...</h4>
			<p>When you're learning something new that you've never tried before, it is easy to get distracted and disouraged. Life happens. I have a one year old, so it was and is important for me to keep an eye on the big picture.</p>

			<p>Some days I get to do a lot of work, other days I am barely able to complete a task on Skillcrush, but I am proud I sat down and did it either way.</p>

			<p>Learning to code has been an exciting challenge so if you love it, even if it takes long, even if you're frustrated, even if you want to quit some days, <em>JUST KEEP GOING!<em></p>
