			<h4>Don't be afraid to fail</h4>
			<p>The only way to fail is by giving up. It doesn't matter if it takes you 100 tries before the bit of code you're working on finally succeeds. It doesn't matter if it takes you a long time to understand a new skill. Keep trying. Keep coding. Never be afraid to "fail".
			</p>
			<h4>Ask for help</h4>
			<p>Being able to figure something out on your own is a valuable skill, but so is knowing when to ask for help. If you're completely stuck, it's a better use of your time to turn to someone who can help. Similarly, give help whenever you can. 
			</p>
			<h4>Practice makes perfect</h4>
			<p>Ok, maybe it doesn't make perfect, but practicing regularly is key. The more you practice, the more you'll know and the more confident you'll be.
