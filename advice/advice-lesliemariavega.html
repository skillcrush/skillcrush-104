			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>Embrace the free-fall and keep a clear perspective. You will be introduced to new ideas and concepts, some that might seem arbitrary or counterintuitive. In reality, you are beginning to stretch your understanding of technology. Embrace the free-fall!</p>

			<p>Appreciate moments of confusion, you are on the cusp of new understanding!</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>A positive perspective will keep you from becoming muddled by the confusion. Try to perceive each lesson and internalize each lesson. </p>

			<p>You are being a responsible adult by learning a new skill. You are supported by your loved ones and by the innumerable members of the international tech community that beckon you- specifically, you!

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
