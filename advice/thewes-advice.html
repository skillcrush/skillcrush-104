			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>It's ok if you don't know what's going on at first.  You won't know what's going on, especially if this is a complete change from what you're used to.</p>

			<p>The important thing to remember is that you are not alone.  There are so many people out there that are learning the same way you are.  You are not the only one scratching their head and stuck on a problem for the last hour, ready to rip your hair out.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>This has been a hard one for me.  I have an overwhelming need to know what I'm doing as I'm doing it.  I need to know exactly what everything is doing and understand why it's doing what it's doing.</p>

			<p>Sometimes you have to just go with the flow and through the process with trust that at the end you will understand.</p>
