			<h4> Practice is perfect.</h4>
 				<p>Keep practicing coding PSDs to HTML and CSS. Allot time for it! With that said...</p>
 			<h4> Keep to a consistent schedule.</h4>
 				<p>Like learning any new skill, you need discipline to refine your ability. This one is especially hard for me, because I'm a natural go-with-the-flow kind of person.</p>
 			<h4>Confidence is key.</h4>
 				<p>Be confident in your own progress and don't compare yourself to others. Your journey in coding is your own. Remember this, especially if you are working a fulltime job and juggling other responsibilities besides learning how to code!</p>
 			<h4>Have GRIT.</h4>
 				<p>No matter the setbacks, the discouragement (from others or self-inflicted), keep pursuing your learning. Think of the breadth of possibilities -- creative and career-related -- that will be made available to you because you can code! Eyes on the prize, baby.</p>
