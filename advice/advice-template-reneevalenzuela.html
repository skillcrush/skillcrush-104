			<h4>Don't be afraid to start!</h4>
			<p>It all seems confusing at first, but once you start to tackle coding, it' will start to make sense.</p>

			<p>I'm not saying it's all perfectly understandable when you first start the journey. But as long as you keep at it, the more you will understand. The puzzle pieces will start to fit together!</p>

			<h4>Practice, practice, practice!</h4>
