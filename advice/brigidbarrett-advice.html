			<h4>Just start doing it!</h4>
			<p> Sometimes, I get so caught-up in the what-ifs that I get paralyzed and never start something that I want to do. I've been working on improving my follow-through, and taking this course is part of it.</p>

			<h4>Don't let setbacks derail your progress!</h4>
			<p>I have a tendency to scrap a to-do list altogether if I know that all of it can't be finished.</p>

			<p>For example, if I wanted to be up and heading for the gym by 7am, but at 8am I'm still in bed, the gym will get thrown to the side and the whole day might get wasted.</p>

			<p>I think that I should go to bed thinking of three things what I want to get done the next day, such as: </p>
				<ol>
					<li>Go to the gym; </li>
					<li>Finish Skillcrush 105; and</li>
					<li>Dye my hair, because you've been putting it off for weeks and your roots look terrible!.</li>
				</ol>
			<p>And then if only #1 and #2 are finished, 2 out of 3 ain't bad, and nobody else probably notices your roots anyway, or cares.</p>
