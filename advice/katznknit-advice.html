			<h4>Don't be too hard on yourself</h4>
			<p>Keep in mind that when you are learning something new you it won't always make sense to you the first time through.  That's okay - it's new so it's not suppose to make sense right away.  Keep working at it and eventually you'll find that your starting to understand things you hadn't earlier.</p>
