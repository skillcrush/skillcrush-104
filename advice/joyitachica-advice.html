			<h4>If you have perfectionistic tendencies - be kind to yourself</h4>
			<p>I'm a person who is used to doing things well the first time, and being able to pick up concepts very quickly. When I started coding, all of this was thrown out the window. Things don't go as planned. It's harder than expected. Even when something looks like it should be working correctly, it doesn't. And then you make a fix and it still doesn't work right. It's a marathon and not a paint by numbers. If any of this feels familiar to you, please know that it's ok to both not be perfect when you code and also to know that it takes time to become used to not being perfect. It will not feel good to make so many mistakes, but it's ok to be out of your comfort zone. And the more you're able to make it feel like a game - like it's fun - the happier you'll be in this new world of code. And boy can it be fun!</p>

			<h4>Choose just a couple people to get advice from, and tune out the rest</h4>
			<p>Every single person you talk to (or at least it feels that way) will tell you the right way to learn how to code. They'll give you advice, tell you which website to learn with or that you shouldn't read anything and just <em>dive into the code and figure it out </em> because that's what they did and it's the only real way that real programmers learn. It becomes maddening and confusing. The best thing I did was find a couple people who's style of learning I related to and who were really good programmers, and I got advice from those few people. And tuned out the rest. It makes it easier to focus and not be distracted by the 10 million ways to do the same thing in programming. And the advice is more likely to be correct.</p>
