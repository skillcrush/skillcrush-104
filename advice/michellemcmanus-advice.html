			<h4>Never trust a monkey! But seriously, always be living!</h4>
			<p>When building your life, no matter whether in your career or your personal life, remember that you are greater than the sum of your parts. You are not entirely your career and therefore, you must nurture your passions and desires that are removed from that. Live life. Do something new and most importantly, keep learning. </p>

			<p>Guard yourself against being lulled to believe the idea you have a stable career. Those days are gone. You must find within yourself the voice that says "I create my opportunity." Be your own master. Be your own CEO.</p>

			<h4>This is life. You must live it.</h4>
			<p>At the end of your life, are you going to look back at the days and years and think, "I'm glad I worked through my Christmas break!" No! What memories will you have? Now is the time to make them. Explore something fun and new. Go for a long hike in the woods. Take a zumba class, perhaps. Find a new meetup group. Your life is like a tapestry and all of these experiences are like the threads. How many colors will yours be?</p>

			<p>This is life. Your job is not the story of your life.</p>

			<p>The key to joy is within you.</p>
