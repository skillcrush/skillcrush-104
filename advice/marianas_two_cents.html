			<h4> You might leave for a while  </h4>
			<p> I enrolled in Skillcrush in the fall of 2014. I got stuck and procrastinated. In 2015, I moved to Vietnam to teach, and while I kept telling myself to keep working on this, it was way more exciting to ride my motorbike in the chaos.</p>

			<p>So, a year went by. I travelled. I had fun. And then I tought, I should really learn to code.</p>
 
			<h4>You can always come back </h4>
			<p> So, instead of 28, I'm 30. Sometimes I get discouraged when I see people who started Skillcrush after me already have tech jobs. But I don't want to be 32 and think about how I should have learned to code when I was 30. </p>

			<p> So, my advice to you is, don't stress out if you lose track. You can always come back. And don't worry too much about perfection. Just ride your motorcycle in the chaos. </p>

			<p> That's my two cents. For the rest, of course, check out other people's advice. They've said it all. </p>
