			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start designing or developing ANYTHING for the first time, it will feel frustrating, but the result will be so rewarding.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. Google and Skillcrush are your best friends when troubleshooting problems. Take the time to really understand new coding concepts before trying to throw together something on a whim, it's ok to not have it all figured out yet. Trust the process.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
