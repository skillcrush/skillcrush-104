			<h4>Don't take the easy way out</h4>
			<p>Often, when you're taking a class, you have an available hint, or answer available to you. It's important to try as hard as you can to figure out the answer on your own, unless you're absolutely stuck. Even if it takes significantly more time, you'll have helped solidify that knowledge in your head much better than if you looked for the answer</p>

			<h4>Don't be afraid to test buggy code</h4>
			<p>Sometimes, I've stumbled on the correct answer simply by applying a little bit of brute force. Try typing things differently and see what happens. Try paths that you don't think will work. See if you can get DIFFERENT errors to occur. Each failed step is closer to the ACTUAL answer</p>
