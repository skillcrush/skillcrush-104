			<h4>Take notes and look at them often</h4>
			<p>When you start programming and designing you need to take notes. I don't mean type notes, I mean actually write them down, draw out examples, and get visual. If are not a kinesthic learner, then start saying it outloud while you do and practice. You have to find a way to commit this information to that part of your memory that doesn't disappear after a week..</p>

			<p>Also, don't stop. Keep going. You'll forget everything if you don't practice!!</p>
