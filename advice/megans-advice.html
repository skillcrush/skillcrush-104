			<h4>Everyone learns differently.</h4>
			<p>This includes the current more mature version of you vs. the younger version of you. It's important to be patient with yourself and not compare how quickly you are learning to anyone else, including your younger self. That will only lead to frustration.</p>

			<p>Instead be patient with yourself and be patient with the other students. You will almost certainly find that some of the classes are easier for you than others, and whats easier and harder is different for different students.</p>

			<h4>Practice early practice often!</h4>
			<p>Pactice and repitition are the keys to making any new skill second nature. The more you work with your new skills the more you will be exposed to unexpected outcomes and the more you will learn from your practice.</p>

			<p>It's also important to keep in mind that your work will never be perfect, but as long as you keep at it, you will keep getting better and better all the time!</p>
