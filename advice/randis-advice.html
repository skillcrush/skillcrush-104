			<h3>Push Through</h3>
			<p>When you start learning to code you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge. It's hard and often confusing. You are learning a new language, several in fact. It takes time to understand the nuances of each of them.</p>

			<h3>It's The Little Things That Count</h3>
			<p>Celebrate the little wins! Every time you figure "it" out. Every project you finish.</p>

			<h3>Ask for Help</h3> 
			<p>Don't paralyze yourself. There are lots of resources available, such as the Skillcrush instructors, Google, Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) to name a few.</p>

			<h3>Breathe</h3>
			<p>If you feel overwhelmed, take a break. Go for a walk, meditate, run an errand, cook a meal. Give yourself some space and do something else for a little while.</p>

			<h3>Remember...</h3>
			<p>When you are learning how to code, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and can feel like it's taking too long.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language, part of your learning process includes training your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
