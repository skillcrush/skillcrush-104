			<h4>Hullo, I'm <a href="http://TheGoldenGooseEggs.com/">Rose Jermusyk</a>, and I learned this the hard way.</h4>
			<p>When I first started in <a href="http://skillcrush.com/blueprint/freelance-wordpress-developer-2/">Skillcrush's Wordpress Developer Blueprint</a>, I came to the game late, about a week before the first month of guided coursework ended. So I plowed through everything in that one week and - feeling pretty smug with myself - pulled out the Brady's Irish Cream to celebrate.</p>

			<p>That was my first mistake. Not the drinking part. The not-making-sure-I-was-actually-done-with-all-the-coursework-before-I-started-drinking part.</p>

			<h4>Celebratory drinking is all well and good so long as it is actually time to celebrate because All The Things are done.</h4>
			<p>Such was not the case for me. I had numerous Irish Cocoas, got bored with waiting for the cocoa to be ready to get to the Irish part, and then it was just me and  the Brady's and the technology which I was continuously eyeing with pride. That was my second mistake.</p>

			<p>When drinking, walk away from All The Technology. Don't keep clicking around all your hard work, don't e-mail your exes, and it probably wouldn't hurt to avoid Twitter (the obvious exception being during the Twilight Zone New Year's Marathon when everyone should have their phone set to tweet in one hand and a bottle of Prosecco set to open in the other). To recap, Mistake One was not making sure I was done with all the schoolwork before I started drinking; and, Mistake Two was continuing to be all up in the technology whilst the drinking was occurring.</p>

			<p>You see, in my drunken state (let's call it Irish Rosie) I happened to notice that I had left one last lesson undone: Security and Back-Ups. Now, I'm a fairly confident person to begin with, but Irish Rosie is unstoppable. As soon as I the lesson video was completed I dived into the work of the lesson and - within a matter of minutes - had locked my root user self out of All The Things, made MAMP my mortal enemy, and totally killed my buzz crying "Oh, woe is me!"</p>
			
			<p>So here's the trifecta of drinking lessons: (1) make use it's actually time to celebrate before pouring yourself a drink; (2) when the container is open, the laptop is shut; and, (3) if you notice something that needs doing and you happen to already be drinking/buzzed, write yourself a note for the sober light of day</p>
			
			<p>After one week on catching up on a month's worth of work, it took one night to ruin it all and one very sober week to figure out a workaround (and that was before the from scratch rebuild). Learn from Irish Rosie's mistake and Don't Drink and Code.</p>
