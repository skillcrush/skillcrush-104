		<h1>Hello, my name is Sheryl and my Grandma always told me never to give advice because the wise man doesn't need it and the foolish man never takes it.</h1>
		<h2>So girls, this is for you....</h2>

			<h4>Keep Breathing</h4>
			<p>Hey you have no idea what you're doing, what ruby is doing or anything else but you're still alive so things can't be that bad, right?</p>

			<h4>Read Around The Subject. Lots.</h4>
			<p>So Skillcrush is great but it moves pretty damn quickly and if you're new to programming languages (as I am) it would probably be a good idea to read up on ruby, get together some resources to fall back on and a good reference guide.  Otherwise by week 4 you'll be totally lost and splashing around looking for help.</p>

			<p>Like me.</p>
