			<h4>Who Cares About Your College Major? JUST DO IT!</h4>
			<p>In a world that is constantly being changed by technology, we all must adapt to it. Whether you are an English major, Fine Arts major, Chemistry major...it doesn't matter. You have to learn what's new that find out a way that will help make yourself better. You don't need to be a Computer Science major to learn this. Use this as an opportunity to stand out from your field.</p>
			
			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

		<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
			
			<h4>Don't Give Up! Rinse and Repeat</h4>

			<p>Learning is really hard. Yet, as humans, you can't go anywhere if you decide to give up.</p>
			
			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
