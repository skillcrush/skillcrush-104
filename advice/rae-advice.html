			<h4>Don't Be Afraid!</h4>
			<p>Embarking on a new journey, trying something new, will always be a scary step. Don't let fear and doubt stop you. Instead, use your fear to fuel your motivation. Everyone who is learning to code out is freaking out, confused, and frustrated, but that all comes with the territory (regardless of skill level, lol). Have fun. If you don't, you'll get so wrapped up in negativity you won't get better.</p>

			<h4>Take A Step Back, and then Breathe!</h4>
			<p>You're going to get confused. You're going to break something and not know how to fix it. You're going to want to cry and throw your computer. When you get to any of these points, stop whatever you're doing, walk away from the computer, and breathe. It's going to be okay.</p>

			<p>There have been so many times when I get so frustrated I just want to curl up into a ball in bed. When I go back to the issue a couple hours later, turns out I was missing a backslash or didn't properly close something. Once you learn more, breathe more, and are more used to programming, confusion will be a normal part of the process. These obstacles will no longer bother you.</p>

			<h4>Code, Code, Code, and then Code Some More!</h4>
			<p>Never stop coding. Even if you know only basic HTML/CSS; that is enough to create a static site. If you get stuck or want to implement something you've never done before, GOOGLE IT! The internet is your best friend forever and has most of the answers you need.</p>

			<p>So no more excuses! Just get in there and code!</p>
