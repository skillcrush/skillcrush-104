			<h4>Take your time.</h4>
			<p>It takes awhile to be able to get to writing code quickly and well. So take your time. It's not a race.
			</p>

			<h4>Don't be afraid to look things up.</h4>
			<p>There are many who came before you. And many who came after you. And even experienced programmers find themselves looking at documentiation and help forums ALL. THE. TIME. So don't be afraid! Dive in!</p>

			<h4>Take time for design</h4>
			<p>Even if it's just sketching out your layout on a napkin, that's better than nothing.</p>
