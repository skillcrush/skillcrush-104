			<h4>Ask questions!</h4>
			<p>Programming is not easy. It takes time to become an expert. If you do not understand a concept, ask questions. There are no silly questions. If you do not understand a topic there is a good chance you have company.</p>


			<h4>Find a mentor</h4>
			<p>This is something I have yet to do, but I follow professionals and newbies on social media. Newbies understand the struggle and pro's can help ease the pain of the struggle.</p>

			<h4>Practice</h4>
			<p>This is a struggle. You must find time to practice in order to perfect. Work, family, and other obligations make it hard to find spare time. Learning a new subject takes time and practice. If learning to code is important, you must make time to strengthen your skills</p>
