			<h4>Failure is key to wisdom.</h4>
			<p>When I was starting out, I wish someone had made me understand that the fear of failure would serve no good purpose. It is only by making attempts to try new things that we ever grow and evolve, and occasionally failing is a natural part of that process. It is not something to be feared. It is something to learn from and value in its own right. </p>
			<h4>One fails forward towards success.</h4>
		<p>C. S. Lewis said: "Failures, repeated failures, are finger posts on the road to achievement. One fails forward toward success." Indeed, sometimes it is only by taking stock of the methods that do NOT work that we can map out a path to the solutions that DO work. Do not be so afraid to fail that you fail to TRY. The former is part of life; the latter is a slow death.
