			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you get that painful feeling in your stomach every time you look at a solution and can't figure out where in the hell the instructor got the code. Just chill. Let it wash over you and know that you're picking up bits and pieces of info that will be more helpful later.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a good thing. It makes you eat less, sleep less, and consider throwing in the towel occasionally. But it also makes the reward that much better.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>Imagine that you could be a developer. Laugh at yourself if you must. But just pretend and go along with it. Imposter syndrome is real. Even the gurus feel it.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing. In other words. Just keep staring and shaking your head. And then go with it. It's like memorizing English grammar. Most of it doesn't make sense anyway.</p>
