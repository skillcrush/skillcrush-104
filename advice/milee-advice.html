			<h4>Coding - where curiosity never ends</h4>
			<p>I started coding when the frames, tables and webpages looks like the default sublime text window. I thought, "How do you do that?". Then I became a view page source fiend. I copied, pasted and was breaking code as much as I was fixing them, but that's how I learned!</p>

			<p>It takes a lot of patience when you first start out and you will make your first big mistake at some point - EVERYONE has. Just ask why, learn from it, move on and keep going!</p>

			<h4>I'm a mechanic!</h4>
			<p>At least, that's what my test results in high school told me I would be suited to. But instead of fixing cars, I fixed code. Flash forward to today, curiousity may kill the cat, but in development, curiosity helps you learn code.</p>
