			<h4>Just keep going!</h4>
			<p>Getting started on a project is hard.</p>

			<p>Tell yourself you're going to work for 5 minutes. Those 5 minutes are way less stressful than coding an entire website.</p>

			<h4>This will at least get you going.</h4>
			<p>And even if you don't want to do more than 5 minutes, at least you'll have done something.</p>

			<p>But I bet once you get to the 5-minute mark, you'll keep going.</p>
