			<h4>How and Why</h4>
			<p>One of the mistakes I made the first time I learned to code was not understanind <span class="emphasis">why</span> something was working the way it was.  I was so focused on figuring out <span class="emphasis">how</span> to get things to work, and never focused on <span class="emphasis">why</span> it worked that way.  Understanding <span class="emphasis">why</span> and <span class="emphasis">how</span> something works allows you to truly know when to use certain technologies as well as how to extend those technologies if and when you need to.</p>

			<h4>Coding is a Jorney</h4>
			<p>Technologies is constantly changing.  Being in a technology field means you become a life-long learner.  You never get to a point where you've <span class="emphasis">learned it all</span> and can become complacent.  Figuring out how to incorporate constant learning and exerpiementation is a key part of being a coder.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="advice-three">
			<h4>Have fun</h4>
			<p>Maybe the most important advice is to make sure your doing something that you enjoy.  Taking the time to figure out what your passion is and invest in making a living doing that is one of lifes secrets.  It's really really hard, but it's worth the soul searching and investment.  </p>
