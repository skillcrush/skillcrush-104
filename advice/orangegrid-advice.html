			<h4>Confusion is NOT your friend - FOCUS!</h4>
			<p>In the beginning I should have listend to others and focused on one project at a time and I probably would be further along in my professional IT freelance journey.</p>

			<h4>Find Your Niche.</h4>
			<p>You cannot be a master of everything. Figure out what you like about this field and pursue it.</p>

			<h4>Nothing is CONSTANT but CHANGE.</h4>
			<p>This is true in the software field. There is always a shiny new object. Be careful not to reach for it if it does not meet your needs that are defined by your goals.</p>

			<h4>GOALS guide YOU - YOU create GOALS</h4>
			<p>Determine your goals and if everything you do is not inline with your goals either re-think your goals or don't do the task.</p>
