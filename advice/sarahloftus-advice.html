			<h4>Confusion is Your Friend!</h4>
			<p>The first time you write some new code, you're probably going to make a mistake, or two, or five. That's OK. In fact, don't even worry about getting it right the first time because the other side of making a mistake is learning to fix it.</p>

			<p>In fact, you're more likely to remember what you've learned if you <i>do</i> have to go through and fix it, than if you got it 100% right the first time. And yes, it's annoying, and it's frustrating, and you'll probably get pissed off at not being able to fix it. That's still OK. Take a break, have a snack, listen to some music (my preference is <i>The Division Bell</i>) and, once you're calmer, go right back to it.</p>

			<h4>That's Impostor Syndrome You're Feeling</h4>
			<p>You're going to feel like you don't know what you're doing, that you'll never be as good as all the <i>other</i> coders out there, that you'll never know all of it.</p>

			<p>You know what? This is still OK. You're just learning, so it's OK not to feel 100% comfortable with what you're doing. And all those other coders? They probably felt <i>exactly the same way you do right now</i>. And no, you may never know all of it, and that's fine because you don't need to, you can find out.</p>

			<p>Finally, you're probably going to feel like this every time you start something new. Don't worry about it, it's normal. You'll get there.</p>

			<p>You'll be OK.</p>
