			<h1>Hi! My name is Ashley and I have some advice for you!</h1>
			<h4>Cut yourself some slack.</h4>
			<p>You're learning a whole new language, a whole new way of thinking. Don't beat yourself up if you struggle to keep up, or even if you fall behind. You can catch up. It <span>will</span> make sense eventually, even if it doesn't feel like it.</p>

			<h4>(Try to) Enjoy the process.</h4>
			<p>It's not always going to make sense, in fact, it often won't. You might feel like you're stumbling along blindly. You're going to feel confused. You'll probably get frustrated. You might feel like throwing your computer out the window (just me?).</p>
			<br>
			<p>Try not to let it get to you, and most importantly, don't give up. It WILL click eventually. You'll have that "ah-ha!" moment. It will make all the frustration worth it (until the next problem comes along that makes you wanto to pull your hair out.)</p>

			<h3> It's supposed to be hard. If it was easy, everyone would do it.</h3>
