			<h4>Do the work!</h4>
			<p>Sure reading about something can teach you, to a degree, but until you start to actually code and type in those terms and symbols—you won't truly understand how to code. </p>

			<p>There have been times in this process where I have done the reading and thought "I don't need to do that exercise, I get what they want me to learn." I have regreted it everytime and had to spend more time going back and looking stuff up again. </p>

			<h4>Mistakes are your friends</h4>
			<p>"Oh no, this doesn't work at all." I have said this so often over my experience. Pouring through my code line by line, semi-colon but lack of semi-colon, is what will really drive things home. Spelling counts, as does a single space—they can make the difference between code that funcutions and code that spits error messages at you.</p>

			<p>The great thing is that mistakes can be fixed and the code wants you to fix it. Most of the programs recommended will not only tell you what kind of mistake you made, but where you made it. This isn't always true, but it is true most of the time, so read what the error message says. </p>

			<h4>Touch typing is a great skill to have</h4>
			<p>I can't touch type, I am an advanced hunt and peck typist. I can not tell you how many mistakes I have made simply by not seeing what I typed as I typed it. I have tried learning touch typing several times, and now I really wish that I had stuck it out.</p>
