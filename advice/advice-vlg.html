			<h4>Never give up!</h4>
			<p>Learning a new language is hard.  Learning your first programming language just might be harder.  But if you keep on trying, it will begin to make sense.</p>

			<h4>Ask for help.</h4>
			<p>When you get stuck (and you will!) ask for help.  Google it; search stackoverflow.com; ask your group; ask your instructor.  Do something!</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
			
			<h4>Don't just do something; sit there!</h4>
			<p>On the other hand, sometimes it's best to spend a little time just mulling over a topic.  Take the time to understand the concepts you're learning.  The Skillcrush guidelines of 3-4 weeks per course are just that &mdash; <em>guidelines</em>.</p>
