			<h4>Don't be afraid to ask questions</h4>
			<p>When I was in college I was never afraid to ask questions because I'd rather "look stupid" than not know the answer to something. Online my experience was different. For some reason the anonymity stymied me for much longer than I am proud to admit. Don't be afraid to ask questions of your classmates, your instructors, and your teaching assistants. We are all in this together, and nobody will judge you for reaching out and asking for help.</p>
			
			<h4>Impostor Syndrome is Real</h4>
			<p>For a very long time I felt  like a fraud. I felt like I wasn't <span>really</span> building the websites and projects I was working on and that the fact that I had someone guiding me through my lessons, as opposed to teaching myself meant that I was cheating and that people would know I didn't really know what I was doing.</p>
			<p>It was so silly! I had never had this experience of feeling like my hard work wasn't my own in any other academic setting, why should I question my work now? This is how people learn, nobody is born knowing how to build a website, and everyone who  has ever done anything in tech (or any field) 
			had to learn it at some point.</p>
			
			<h4> Don't live in a bubble </h4>
			<p> A combination of the first two problems I listed above, I was very embarrassed to talk about what I was learning and building in public, either online or with people offline. I felt like if I didn't know the answer to everything they could ever ask me, that meant that I didn't know anything worthwhile and I should keep my journey and interest to myself until I was already an expert.</p>
			<p> I majored in Women's and Gender Studies in college so I always analyze everything through an intersectional feminist lens, so I don't know how much that skewed my perception in that this was a systemic gender issue, but it did seem like my male peers were much more confident than I was.</p>
			<p> That's why I loved finding Skillcrush; the fact that it was a community of mostly women (and therefore mostly people who knew and understood all of these mixed emotions) was a major MAJOR plus for me. What I think the most important takeaway from this isn't that skillcrush is the only option, but that it's so important to find resources and community that works for you, where you don't have to feel self-conscious or embarrassed by being a newbie. </p>
