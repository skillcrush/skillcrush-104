			<h4>There are no dumb questions!</h4>
			<p>Always remember there is only one way to learn and that is by asking questions.</p>

			<p>In order to learn we need to fail, embrace the learning process. </p>

			<h4>Perseverance and determination are key to your success.</h4>
			<p> No matter how hard it looks or how stuck or confused you feel you will eventually find an answer to the challenges you encounter.</p>

			<p>When this happens take a break and re-look at the problem at a later time. Most of the times all we need is a fresh perspective. </p>

			<p>The only way to become an expert at something is by practicing.</p>
