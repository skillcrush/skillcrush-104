		<h1>Advice from a Fellow Newb</h1>
			<h2>Hi, I'm <a href="https://www.kessiah.com/" target="_blank">Kessiah</a> and here's some advice from one newb to another:</h2>

			<h4>This stuff is hard (but most rad things are hard at first)</h4>
			<p>Welcome to the madness! I'm right there with ya. When I first started learning code (like, three minutes ago) it was super exciting and very intimidating (and it still is). But the elation when you figure out even just one little thing is akin to jumping off a high swing for the first time and shreiking "LOOK AT ME! LOOK AT ME!" Just keep pumping your legs. Eventually you'll start to swing.</p>

			<h4>You are capable of learning new things</h4>
			<p>In fact, learning new things strengthens the pathways of your brain and keeps it working, so by challenging yourself with this stuff, you could actually be staving off Alzheimers! Improving your memory! Preparing to save the world?! This makes me feel better when I'm tempted to crawl back to the comfort of familiarity.</p>

			<h4>People do this all the time</h4>
			<p>Whenever I get mired in self-doubt I remind myself that my college roommate <em>taught herself</em> code when she was 13 (<em>13!!!</em>) and now works as a mega-successful full time freelance designer/developer. That usually pulls me out of my pity party and reminds me that people successfully do this every day and WE WILL BE THOSE PEOPLE.</p>

			<h4>Thank goodness for Skillcrush</h4>
			<p>Can I get a big Hallelujah that we don't have to teach this stuff to ourselves (at any age) and that we have this magical, affordable, EMPOWERING, invaluable curriculum to hold our hands and guide us through every step of the way!? All the fist bumps, <a href="https://skillcrush.com/" target="_blank">Skillcrush</a>. (I swear I'm not a plant, I'm just super grateful.)</p>
