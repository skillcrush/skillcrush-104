      <h4>Networking with people.</h4>

			<p>I've played around with coding for awhile and never got involved with
				projects or other coders. That was a big mistake, working and talking
				with others will help you grow much faster and when you hit wall it
				can make life easier for you.</p>

			<p>Here's a link to a site to find other people looking for coders to help
				with a project or just to talk <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingBuddies/">
