			<h4>Don't Worry About Doubt!</h4>

			<p>When you start programming -- or before you even start -- you might feel some doubt. Are you going to be successful? Are you going to fail? I had these same thoughts when I first started.<br>
				Once I started learning programming skills, though, I wasn't as nervous -- the unknown was becoming a little bit more "known," so to speak.</p>

			<p>My advice is, don't let doubt prevent you from trying something just because you don't know what the outcome will be. Not everything is going to make sense right away,<br>
				 and you have to keep practicing in order for it make sense.</p>

			<h4>Fake It Until You Make It!</h4>

			<p>Embracing your doubt will push you to really think about what you're coding, because, well, you doubt that it will work, and your code will be stronger for it.<br>
				 Look for every little error, test it until it works and ask for help when you need it.</p>

		<p>Sometimes just pretending to have confidence will help you feel confident. Once you start understanding how coding works<br>
			 and you remember all those little things that seemed impossible to remember, you'll actually start to feel confident.</p>
