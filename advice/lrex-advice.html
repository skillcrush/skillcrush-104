			<h4>Take Notes</h4>
			<p> I can't tell you how many times I have had to go back to my Notes
				to remember something that I had learned five minutes prior. Even though
				they give you the cheatsheets, there it something about writing it with your 
				own hand that helps you to go back and understand it better.</p>
				<p>
					Also, color is your friend in your notes. Hightlight things to make it stand out.
					You will end up taking so many notes that you will need that color to help you
					find the information quickly.
