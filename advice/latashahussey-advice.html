			<h2>Don't Be Afraid</h2>
			<p>Learning a new skill can be pretty scary. Most of us were terrified the first time we learned to code and that's okay. It will take time, but with lots of practice you'll be fine.</p>

			<h2>Get Support</h2>
			<p>Seek out communities of support such as other programmers, community groups, forums, and meet-ups. Attend developer conferences to stay informed of the latest trends. There's a ton of support out there.</p>


      <h2>Teach Others</h2>
			<p>You may be thinking,"How can I teach someone how to program and I am not an expert?" Teaching someone else the skills you've learned helps build your confidence and maintains your skills. You don't need to be a chef to cook for your family, do you? The same thing goes for programming.</p>

			<h2>Write Everything Down</h2>
			<p>Most of us Google just about everything which is great, except when it comes to solving issues that are super specific. Some solutions are a mashup of several sources. Two steps from this site, a few more from another site. </p>
			<p>Create your own documentation (in your own words) that outlines the exact steps you took to resolve an issue or something like how to align images on page using CSS.  Whatever you discover, write it down. I personally use <a href="http://www.evernote.com" target="_blank" >Evernote</a>, which serves as my personal knowledge base.
