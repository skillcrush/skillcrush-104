				<h4>Focus on building something cool!</h4>
				<p>When you first start out there will be a lot to take in. Have fun with it! Coding is all about building things!</p>

				<p>The best thing about coding is looking at the changes and final product. There's no better feeling than looking at a webpage and thinking "I built that".</p>

				<h4>Pay attention to the little things</h4>
				<p>Sometimes the smallest thing like a missing end bracket or a typo can break your code. If you're stuck and cant figure out why something won't work take a break and come back with "fresh eyes" a lot of the time the error sticks out like a sore thumb</p>
