			<h4>Be Patient with Yourself!</h4>
			<p>Starting off is tough, especially if you haven't done any coding before.  Don't overwhelm yourself by taking on too much at one time, because it's very easy to get frustrated and confused.</p>

			<p>Sometimes you have to step away, take a deep breath and stare at something else besides your computer screen.  Be patient and it will come.</p>

			<h4>You can do this!</h4>
			<p>When you took the first step and put down a pretty penny to learn to code, you believed that you can do this.  You still can.</p>

			<p>Sometimes you will feel that it's too hard or confusing, but remember, you took that first step.  Since you took the first step, you can take the next, and the one after that.</p>

			<p>You didn't get here because you quit.  I believe you can do this, so do it!</p>
