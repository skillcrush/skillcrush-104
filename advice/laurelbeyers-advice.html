			<h4>Be kind to yourself</h4>
			<p>Getting the hang of code takes time and practice. If you are learning this on the side while working and enjoying life with friends and family you may need to step away for a bit to take a break. Do it! The great thing about skillcrush is you can do the course at your own pace. Don't burn yourself out, sometimes the best thing to do is step away from what you are struggling with, give your brain a break and then come back to it when you are ready to problem solve again.
