			<h4><span>Never</span> give up!</h4>
			<p>There will be times when it will get confusing, where you think it will be too hard. Don't give up! Part of the journey is turning into those dead-end streets, and then backing out and taking the path that will let you gain even more knowledge!</p>

			<p>You might take a long break in between studying sessions. Maybe work is making you too tired. Maybe there are family obligations that you have to take care of. Maybe, sometimes, you just don't feel like tackling a coding problem today. Take a break! But don't give up. If you have to review stuff, then review it! But never give up!</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<h4>Make studying a habit</h4>
			<p>Maybe it's hard to consistently put aside 2 or 3 hours to study. That's fine. Make it an hour, then! Join something like #100daysofcode to make you more accountable. Find out where your distractions are, and try to minimize them. Is it tv? Your favorite music app? Whatever it is, put it to the side for a bit. You might not have to cut it out of your life, but you can at least limit the amount of time that it's taking away from you.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
