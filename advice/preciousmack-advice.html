			<h4>Run toward what scares you!</h4>
			<p>I heard this quote, which is attributed to former First Lady Michelle Obama, in Sean Hanson's excellent interview on the  <a href="https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast/what-s-a-quiet-developer" target="_blank">CodeNewbie podcast</a> the other day. He was talking about taking up public speaking at tech conferences, but this mindset totally applies to learning to code. It is <em>scary, intimidating, and... awesome!</em> I wish I had started sooner.</p>

		<div class="advice-container">
			<h4>It's okay to be a quiet developer.</h4>
			<p>This bit of advice is also from the same podcast reference above (no copyright infringement intended &#9786;). Choose quality over quantity and let your authentic self come through in everything you do. You are more than your github repo and your professional portfolio. Having a full life will make your work better because you will actively work to do what you love.</p>
		</div>

    <div class="advice-container">
			<h4>You are NOT an imposter!</h4>
			<p>Everyone started learning HTML by typing the DOCTYPE declaration. Everyone. <em>Everyone!</em> There will always be something you don't know. And, that is totally ok. Tech is full of learning opportunities. The more you code, create, and build, the better developer you will become. But, right at this moment, YOU ARE ALREADY AWESOME!</p>
