           <ol>
			 <li><h4>Learn how to Google</h4>
				<p>This is a key skill as a developer. Answers you need to any question you might have you will find online, but knowing HOW and WHERE to find them is the tough part. 
				Learn exactly which search terms are going to get you the answers you need.
				How to Google for things is part of the learning process and when you are under pressure in a real, working environment this skill will be invaluable.</p>
			 </li>

             <li><h4>Don’t be afraid to ask for help or to help people back</h4>
				<p>When you start to code you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, so don't be shy. There are tons of people with experience ready to help you on the web.</p>
			 </li>

             <li><h4>Learn by doing. Play with the code while learning</h4>
				<p>With every new subject, the sooner you start playing with the code, the faster you will learn the given concepts. <em>Build a project as you go through the material. A personal project is often the best starting point.</em></p>
		     </li>

			  <li><h4>Get involved with Open-Source projects</h4>
					<p>Contributing to open source for the first time can be scary and a little overwhelming. Start with small and easy contributions.
					You’ll gain some great experience and meet some fantastic people along the way.
					Btw many companies will not hire a developer who isn't active within the open source community. <br />
					Explore Some Open Source Projects:</p>

					  </li>

					  </li>
					</ul>
               </li>
			

	            <li><h4>Keep calm and keep on coding</h4>
					<p>You should expect to fail repeatedly and be patient with your progress, because becoming an expert at anything requires hard work and time. And if a single doubt ever cross your mind, remember that every programmer has walked this path before. Just keep codind and don't give up.</p>
