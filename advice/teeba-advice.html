			<h4>It's a journey but you will love it!</h4>
			<p>Believe in yourself. Don't give up. Know that it's a journey with a lot of rocks on the road, but these rocks are part of your growth and development</p>

			<p>But don't forget that the journey has rivers and lakes too. Enjoy it because it really never ends as it's an amazing growth experience both perosnally and professionally!</p>

			<h4>Practice plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, remember what your teachers always told you: practice! Practice will be your friend. Even if it's everyday for 15 miniutes. You will retain much faster than you think possible</p>

			<p>This is an essential part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>Learn to love your mistakes and embrace them. Learn to ask questions and check online resources. Always remember you are not alone, many skillcurshers are going on the same journey you are!</p>
