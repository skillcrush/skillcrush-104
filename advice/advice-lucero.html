			<h4>Don't get stuck on a single problem for too long. Walk away and come back</h4>
			<p>When something's not working, you can get sucked in and spend hours on tiny little edits trying to figure out what's wrong until you're tired and completely frustrated. Do that very often and you're likely to come to hate the entire language or section of the page you're working on. So if after 10-15 minutes you still can't get it to work, walk away for a while. This can mean moving on to a next task in your code, or literally getting up and grabbing a breath of fresh air outside for a few moments. A clear head might help you spot the problem when you come back. And if it's still not working... </p>
			<h4>Don't be ashamed to look up the answer or ask for help</h4>
			<p>Someone somewhere may already have run into your problem before. If you don't want to bother anyone with your quesiton, just google your problem and chances are you'll find an answer that helps you on your way.</p>
			<h4> P.S.: remember to validate! </h4>
			<p> your problem can be hiding in a small syntax error you are overlooking. So before you panic, validate! </p>
