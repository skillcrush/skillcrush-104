			<h4>Celebrate the small victories</h4>
			<p>Being goal oriented can help you focus but every once in a while, don't forget to give yourself a pat on the back.</p>

			<p>Because being too focused on the destination might make you miss the journey.</p>

			<h4>It is okay to not know why sometimes</h4>
			<p>When learning a new language or skill, we can often be very conscious and curious, which allows us to learn as we do. But getting too caught up on small details early on can be hurtful.</p>

			<p>It's okay to not know everything, you possibly cannot know everything, no one can. The answers will come to you in thier own time.</p>

			<h2>Keep learning.</h2>
