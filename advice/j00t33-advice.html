			<h4>How to learn coding</h4>
			<p>
				1. Practice - Coding is like math. If you do not pratice, you will forget things soon.
			</p>

			<p>
				2. Change view - Did this ever happen to you, when a person explains something to you in a certain way, you do not understand anything and later when someone else explains it to you in a diiferent way, you understand it. Coding is like that. When you do not understand something, try to understand it from someone / somewhere else.

				<span class="code">
					while (coding == 'do not get it') {	<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look_for_a_different_answer();	<br />
					}
				</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				3. Try things - Try to learn different tools or technology. Knowing how to cook food with different delicious ingredients can make your food more tastier.
			</p>

			<p>
				4. Keep looping - Repeat step from 1 to 3.
