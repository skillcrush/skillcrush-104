			<h4>I Love Getting Confused!</h4>
			<p>When first starting out with Skillcrush, I was having so much fun. I still am now, but I am starting to get to points in lessons where I often get super confused and overwhelmed.</p>

			<p>But that confusion is really important because it allows me to have to go back and figure out where I went wrong.
			And most the time it's a stupid minor error that I overlooked.  But all in all, at least I learned from it, right?</p>

			<h4>Slowing Down When Needed</h4>
			<p>To be honest, most of the time I'm stoked on being able to learn this new skill.  I honestly didn't think I would be able to.</p>

			<p>However it can get overwhelming when having to juggle classes with work, so I slow down when I need to, in order to not get too overwhelmed.</p>
