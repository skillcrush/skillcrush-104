			<h4>Never Give-Up!</h4>
			<p>Learning to code is really challenging. There will be times when you are feeling on top of the world and really making headway and others when you will feel completely helpless, alone and beyond frustrated. Those difficult times can be what make us as coders strong.  Finding a way through the forest of tangled code can help us to grow. If we can manage to not give up and stay determined we grow. </p>

			<p>Often times we might think negatively about ourselves and our ability to learn this new craft. Stay positive and be patient with yourself. Remember you are never alone there are literally thousands of coders just like you only a couple mouse clicks away. </p>

			<h4>Know when to ask for help.</h4>
			<p>In the very beginning I would become completely obsessed in solving a problem or trying to figure out why my code wouldn’t work. So much so, that it would begin to become counterproductive. One day I decided that I would ask for help. I found that it wasn’t shameful, and that there were tons of people ready to help. This led me to a new practice I have adopted. If I become stuck I will give myself a time limit to spend trying to sort it out on my own. If I exceed that limit then I go online and begin to look for help from other more experienced coders. I have found that many times this practice has preserved my sanity while maintaining some level of productivity. </p>
