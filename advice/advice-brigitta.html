			<h2>Prepare for a lifetime of learning.</h2>
			<p>When you start out learning about coding and web development, you might think that if you go through all the exercises of a certain course, by the end of the three or six months, you'll be a fully-fledged web developer, you'll get your dream job and you'll live happily ever after.</p>

            <p>You will, I promise.</p>
            
            <p>It's just that you can't really stop learning after the course has finished. Or ever again. You will have to keep learning about web development and its awesome languages and new possibilities and technologies day after day. And this is the magic and the real beauty of programming, I think. It is such a huge and growing area, that you cannot possibly know every single thing about it at any given point in your coding life. And if you want to stay in the game and progress in your new career, you will have to learn something new every single day anyway.</p>
            
            <p>But why am I telling you this?</p>
            
            <p>Because if you are curious by nature, you gonna love this! Right now it may look a bit scary and confusing, but with time, you will appreciate the constant mental challenges you have to face, the amazing feeling when you finally solve something you'd struggled with for hours or days, and the infinite diversity of your work. So keep learning, never give up and most importantly, have fun! Because this is one of those few careers where you can actually have some fun at work.</p>
