			<h4>Ask for help --</h4>
			<p>Don't be afraid to ask for help when you're stumped. It's okay to not know all the answers, especially when just starting out! Use all the resources available to you. Everyone wants to see you succeed!</p>

			<p>Do, however, attempt to problem-solve on your own before asking for help or a solution key. Learning how to tackle a difficult problem and search for the answer is a GREAT skill to learn and one you will be using forever.</p>

			<h4>Keep going --</h4>
			<p>When starting out, there is a lot of new information being thrown your way and a lot of helpful resources to use. Don't feel overwhelmed, just keep powering through. More often than not, it will all make sense in the end, and you'll feel good about your new skill set.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>That being said, go at a pace that is comfortable FOR YOU. But also, push yourself to go a little further. Do one more practice activity. Write a few more lines of code. Add an image to your website. Figure out why that nav bar won't stay put. Whatever it is, just do it. You'll thank yourself later : ]</p>
