			<h4>Don't Wait, Do It!</h4>
			<p>If you're thinking about taking up coding and web design, don't put it off or wait. Commit to spending time each week to learning how to code.</p>

			<h4>Sometimes Learning Requires Blind Faith</h4>
			<p>When learning something new you don't always have to understand every detail of a process or concept before moving forward. Sometimes, especially when something is confusing or overwhelming, you have to just follow the steps given and trust the process, or have "blind faith" in learning by doing.</p>

			<h4>When You Get Stuck, Reach Out</h4>
			<p>It's good to try and solve your own problems. It's bad to get stuck in solving your problems. And don't be stubborn! When you've given it your best, take a break and reach out to peers. Ask if they've run into the same problem and how they solved it. There's a 99.9% chance that someone else has and can give you guidance to work through the problem. </p>
