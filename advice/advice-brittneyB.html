			<h4>JavaScript is confusing, and that's okay.</h4>
			<p>When you go through the JavaScript class with Skillcrush, there will be lots of questions and frustrating points. Take good notes while you go through the lessons and challenges, so you're <em>climbing up to success</em> rather than  <a href=" https://youtu.be/u8JtwkhYgLY">riding on the struggle bus.</a>
			</p>

			<p>Always be sure to ask questions, and investigate! There are thousands and thousands of resources online that cover exactly what you're confused about, or very close to your problem. </p>
			<p> Read the errors that you're recieving. </p>
			<p> Copy the error you're getting, and search on Google. </p>
			<p> Ask TA or classmates on Mightybell for help </p>
			<p> Post on your question on Stack Overflow, Reddit, or a similar kind of website to help with programming questions. </p>
			<h4>Above all, take a break, and come back to your problems with a fresh head! You'll have a <span id = "discovery"><h4 id = "redH4">eureka moment!</h4></span>
       </h4>
