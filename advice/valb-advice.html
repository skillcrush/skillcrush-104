			<h4>You Don't Know Everything... and that's OK</h4>
			<p>It's very easy to get frustrated when you start new things. Sometimes you just don't get it. Sometimes you think, "I'm ver going to get it." And, sometimes, it's hard to believe that you are ever going to do this naturally, remember all those codes, be able to do anything without going back and looking at every step.</p>
			<p>Just keep in mind that that's what learning is. You're not expected to be able to do/remember/succeed in everything on the first go. Or even the thirtieth. The more you practice, the easier it will become. Soon everything will become more natural and you'll forget you ever had doubt in the first place.
