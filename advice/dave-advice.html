			<h4>Starting out.</h4>
            <p>I first started trying to learn how to code with just an idea and the internet.  I taught myself the basics, but tried to learn to run before I could walk by jumping straight into Ruby on Rails without understanding Ruby.  I'm hoping that Skillcrush has picked me up and dragged me along in the right way to prevent that again.</p>
                
            <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>I know feel like I can give it a go and understand it step by step.  I feel like I can ask questions on Stack Exchange and understand the responses.  I feel like I know my limitations better and can code better.  I feel like I can make every day tasks simpler with coding.</p>
