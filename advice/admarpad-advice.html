			<h4>It is you, not the computer, who are the master</h4>
			<p>Let's face it. The computer has no mind of its own unless you tell the computer what you want it to do. That is the role of a programmer. The computer may have the capabilities to do anything, but because it doesn't think for itself, it doesn't know what to do with its amazing superpowers. You, on the other hand, are the computer's mind and soul. Therefore, using your programming skills, whether simple or complex, you would be able to become the computer's mind and soul. All you have to do is to tell it what you want it to do and the computer shall do what you ask it to do.</p>

			<h4>Do you feel like a fraud? This is what we call IMPOSTOR SYNDROME.</h4>
			<p>You are not alone who would suffer from impostor syndrome. Everyone, including the most expert of all experts of development, suffers from impostor syndrome. But the good thing about it is that you are given plenty of chances to get yourself back up again, find fixes to your problems and help others fix their problems. The impostor syndrome will not just disappear quickly, but when you are on the dumps of feeling like a fraud, always tell yourself this:</p>
			<p><em>"I am a web developer, NOT a wanna-be web developer."</em></p>

			<h4>There are no dumb questions.</h4>
			<p>In web development and computer programming, to become a powerful developer/programmer, you must show your weakness. This is when you start asking questions that may or may not have obvious questions, not to yourself, but for your fellow developers/programmers around you who are (most likely) going through the same internal dilemma as you are.</p>

			<p>The reality is, when you are working on a project, chances are, you are also given a deadline. You do not have all the time in the world to declare that you can't do it, because the truth is, you really can't do things on your own. That is why you belong in a team of like-minded people such as yourself when you step into the professional scene of development and programming. Your superiors and your fellow colleagues expect you to contribute to the project, and one of the strongest actions that you could do to contribute to the team is to ask questions.</p>
			
			<p>When you ask questions, this is an indication that you understand the objectives but still unclear with a few things on the side. When you ask questions, you become a developer/programmer who knew nothing to knowing something. In addition, when you ask questions, they can be a trigger to giving you new ideas to contribute to the project.</p>

			<p>The professionals and higher-ups would rather work with someone who is an "idiot" than someone who is a know-it-all. Because, when you are an idiot, you have a chance to learn new things from your peers, and in addition, you also share what you know to these expert peers who probably didn't know what you may know in return. As an "idiot," you have a chance to learn and create something special along with your peers, and remember, you become stronger together. When you fall down, the others will fall, but everyone will get back up again as long as you get back up yourself.</p>
