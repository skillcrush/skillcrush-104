			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app, you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before. Don't forget the reason you started!!</p>

			<p>You will experience confusion and frustration often, and from what I hear, even the best developers experience it, just not as often as beginners.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>Learn to walk away for a few minutes to let your mind relax. When you're ready to return, take a deep breath, and begin reviewing the steps you took to get to the point of your problem. You may realize your mistake along the way, or your code will just work...like magic! Do not be afraid to Google answers or look to your peers for help.</p>
