			<h4>Everything is Figure-Outable.</h4>
			<p>In a feminist group I work with, one of the women last week told a story about her discovery that her "tech-savvy" boyfriend was really just using google.   That realization spurred her to take ownership of her trajectory in tech, and spawned the mantra "Everything is figure-outable."   Whenever I'm feeling overwhelmed by the sheer amount that I don't know, I take a deep breath and repeat to myself that everything is figure-outable.  If it's not coming to you yet, don't stress out.  The slow, steady learner ends up having the most thorough understanding in the end. </p>

			<p>So, whenever you're feeling overwhelmed--give yourself a break!  Everything is figure-outable, you've just got to put in the time.   The more work you do, the clearer things become.  And, of course, there's always google!  :)</p>

			<h4>Code Every Day. </h4>
			<p>I have a tendency to work in manic cycles--in two days I can spend twenty hours coding, but then I won't look at my code for a week.  This has been my biggest struggling point, as my brain calcifies pretty quickly.  Every time I spend a week away from html, or css, or java, I have to spend precious time reminding myself of basics--syntax, positioning, the layout idea I was working on--when I should be using that time to spruce up the project.</p>

			<p>While, obviously, you can't code EVERY every day (my mom would totally kill me if I tried to pull out my laptop during Thanksgiving to do a bit of work!), it's good to get in the habit of putting in a bit of work each day, so that you keep your brain fresh.  It's all about minimizing your time on the boring stuff--like syntax--and maximizing the fun stuff--like UI optimization and problem-solving!</p>

			<p>So get out those schedules, find a nice block, and pencil in some coding time!</p>
