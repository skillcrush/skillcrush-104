			<h4>Take the time to create a solid foundation of understanding!</h4>
			<p> I began coding by taking courses online through Coursera, which I loved. The course I began with was generally a beginner course, however, it was a beginner course for people who already had an understanding of the industry. I thought to myself, “I already have an idea of what’s going on, I’ve read enough blogs and articles.”  I ended up backtracking and going back to square one to learn industry terms. I would recommend that you start at the very beginning and create a solid foundation to build onto. It would have saved me time in the long run!</p>

			<p>This advice can be applied to every new technology that you learn along the way as well. Take the time to learn where it is coming from, what it is doing, and what the end result will be.</p>

			<h4>Walk away and save your sanity!</h4>
			<p>Don’t spend more than 20 minutes trying to find that one mistake. Walk away and save your sanity. Go work on something else for a while. Then come back with a fresh mind. 20-30 minutes is my personal limit, you can figure out what yours is as you go. I find that by walking away or turning my attention to a different issue, the solution to the problem will come to me, or when I return, I will see the mistake that I made much easier the second time around.</p>
