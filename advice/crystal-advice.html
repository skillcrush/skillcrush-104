			<h3>Just Go!</h3>
			<p>There's so many resources available that it can be overwhelming at times to know just where to begin. At times, I ended up with analysis paralysis where I was analyzing available resources to the point I wasn't actually learning anything. If I could go back I would tell myself to just start somewhere, even if I ended up taking a different direction later on. Just GO!</p>

			<h3>When in doubt, ask!</h3>
			<p>As mentioned before, there are so many resources available, if you have a questions it's most likely been asked before. All you have to do is ask, search, Google, etc. you're bound to find an answer</p>
			
			<h3>Celebrate the Wins</h3>
			<p>There may be times you don't think you're getting anywhere in the process. Keep a journal or notes on what you've worked on, you'll be surprised how quickly things start to build. Soon you'll be able to look back 2 weeks, 2 months, a year and see how far you've come </p>
