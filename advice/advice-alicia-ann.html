			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<ul>
			  <li>Codepen is awsome for quickly messing around with HTML, CSS, and Javascript</li>
			  <li>Starting to code is hard because you don't know what you don't know, ya know?</li>
			  <li>Having a mentor can really help with comprehension</li>
			  <li>Join a local meetup group so you can network and learn at the same time!</li>
			  <li>Sometimes it's best to take a break when you have an error, and come back with fresh eyes</li>
