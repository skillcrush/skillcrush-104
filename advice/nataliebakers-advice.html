			<h4>Software Development is Hard!</h4>
			<p>So, when you start coding, it all seems really exiting, and you're picking up new concepts left and right, anything seems possible! And that's true, but sooner or later we all hit a learning curve.</p>

			<p>When that happens, questions may run through your mind, like "Why did I think I could do this?" or "How will I ever get beyond this beginner stuff and start building real apps?" Those are valid questions, because software development is hard!</p>

			<h4>Just Keep Swimming!</h4>
			<p>Software development is hard for sure, but tons of people do it every day, and they all started out with your same level of knowledge or less! Some concepts just take a little more time and effort.</p>

			<p>If you're feeling burned out on a project or lesson, try to take a break. Go for a walk, watch some TV, work on a different lesson for a while. Keep moving and circle back to the frustrating concept when you have recovered a bit.</p>

			<p>Sometimes your brain just needs a break and to refocus. If you are still having trouble, don't be afraid to ask for help. I like to ask in facebook groups because it's easy to carry on a conversation, share code, and collaborate with other group members. A sense of community and seeing others struggle and overcome challenges is a great way to keep your morale up when you are feeling frustrated!</p>
