			<h4>Network Often!</h4>
			<p>Even if you're not much of a social butterfly, you never know who will be hiring and what connections each individual may have. Not only can you make a stellar group of friends with a common interest but you may land an awesome job in this manner!</p>


			<h4>Learn Constantly.</h4>
			<p>The internet is full of both free and paid resources that can help you improve your current skillset or even learn a new one! Technology is constantly growing and, therefore, you should too!</p>
