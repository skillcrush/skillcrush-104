			<h4>Consistency is key.</h4>
			<p>Code every day. Even if it's only for 15 minutes.</p>

			<p>The longer you go between coding sessions, the less you will retain. It will only frustrate you and delay your progress if every time you sit back down at the keyboard, you have to start from scratch.</p>

			<h4>Network, even if it's hard.</h4>
			<p>Look, I get it. You got into coding because your introverted self loves nothing more than banging away at your computer without speaking for hours.</p>

			<p>But as much as it may intimidate or scare you, going to local meet-ups and, you know, <em>meeting people</em> will really help you on your journey. I have met so many interesting people by going to hack nights, listening to lightning talks, and finding out the types of work opportunities are out there.</p>

			<p>So put on the big girl pants and <em>GO</em>.</p>
