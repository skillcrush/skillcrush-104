			<h4>Easy = Bad & Hard = Good</h4>
			<p>First thing to remember...if it's easy that means you're doing well but it WILL get hard so take this as a good sign to start and a bad sign after awhile.</p>

			<p>If it's hard - good.  It means you're making all the mistakes you can while learning.  This is the key to development.  If it wasn't hard, then it wouldn't be worth it in the end.</p>

			<h4>Run with it!</h4>
			<p>Whether every time you touch the computer something goes wrong or it goes really right, go with it!</p>

			<p>The learning process is that - a process.  One that we all need to work on everyday in order to make the changes we want.</p>

			<p>Ask for help - it makes all the difference in the world!</p>
