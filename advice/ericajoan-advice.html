				<p id ="top-line"> The programming community is often praised for how everyone helps each other out. At Codementor, an online platform with 3000+ expert developers who can provide users 1:1 programming mentorship, we are able to reach out to senior developers/engineers who work at companies such as Facebook and Amazon to host free, live Q&A sessions on our site, where you can ask them anything from career advice, opinions, and more. </p>
				<p>Perhaps you’re an aspiring software developer/engineer unsure of whether you’re on the right path, or maybe you’re a newbie eager for guidance from someone experienced. This article is a summary of various tips and advice seasoned devs have to share with beginners to programming. </p>
				<p>Without further ado, let’s get into what the developer community wants you to know!</p>
			</div>
			<div id = "tip-1">
				<h4> Tip #1: Practice!</h4>
				<img src = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/codementor_content/2016-Jan-week1/practice.gif" alt= "Tip #1 Photo" width="470" height="313"/>
				<p>You won’t get anywhere if you just sit on your ass and lament that you suck at coding. Asides from following tutorials, you should work on your own projects. </p>
				<p>“The most fundamental thing is that you actually go and code,” says Andrei Thorp from Evernote. “I’ve heard it recommended that by the time you finish college, you should have written 100,000 lines at minimum.”</p>
				<p>But how to get started, you may ask.</p>
				<p>“I always tell people to find something they’re doing more than once a week and to try to automate it. Ignore if anyone else has solved the problem before, and just make a tool/utility for yourself that fixes a common issue in your life,” says Kasra Rahjerdi, who’s the Mobile Lead at Stack Overflow. </p>
				<p>“Like any other skill, it takes practice – deliberate practice, stepping outside of your comfort zone and learning the nuance and subtleties – that set apart great from good,” says Derick Bailey, the creator of WatchMeCode.net. Derick is a top 0.42% StackOverflow user, and has also contributed to open source frameworks such as has MarionetteJS and BackboneJS. </p>
				<p>It’s OK to fail. Coding is all about failing and fixing things, and about learning how to do things better. If you don’t build things and work on areas that you know you are weak on, you’ll never get better. </p>
				<p>If you ever need to receive advice on how to improve and what you’re not doing so well on, feel free to ask an experienced developer to help your get straightened up by either reviewing your code or walking you through concepts you are having trouble understanding.</p>

				<h4> Tip #2: Be Patient</h4>
				<img src ="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codementor_content/2016-Jan-week1/patience.jpg" alt="Tip #2 Photo" width="470" height="313"/>
				<p>No-brainer here, but beginners often wind up frustrated by their lack of progress and forget that they’re not alone. </p>
				<p>“Becoming a good programmer takes a long, long time and a lot of tedious evenings,” says Mike Arpaia, a former Etsy dev who now builds information security software for Facebook. Mike stresses that beginners should give up on the assumption that one can become an excellent developer quickly. “Before you can write good code, you have to write hundreds of thousands of lines.”</p>
				<p>But… What if you’re not even past the tutorial stages yet? What if you’re still banging your head against the wall and wondering perhaps you’re just not cut out for programming? Before you leap to conclusions, know that everyone has a different learning style. Author of the Ruby on Rails Tutorial, Michael Hartl, points out that beginners should try lots of different resources (books, videos, etc.) to see what ‘clicks’.</p>
				<p>In fact, Craig Coffman, the CTO of Reserve, has personally learned through a lot of trial-and-error and by picking projects that were personal and interesting. However, since all the interesting challenges are big ones, he suggests beginners to start with biting off reasonably-sized pieces. “That way, when you lose interest or get stuck, you still have a feeling of progress and accomplishment.”</p>

				<h4>Tip #3: Stay interested </h4>
				<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codementor_content/2016-Jan-week1/havefun.gif" alt="Tip #3 Photo" width="470" height="313" />
				<p>If you’re bored by the project you’re working on, you should probably reconsider any lofty goals of learning to code. Or, maybe you’re just working on the wrong project or learning through the wrong resource. </p>
				<p>Always keep yourself motivated through working on personal projects that excites you. </p>
				<p>Coraline Ada Ehmke, founder of LGBTech and contributor to high-profile open source projects such as Rails and RSpec, started coding at a young age out of interest. However, her first class in college as a Computer Science major made her doubt her passion. “I remember our semester-long project was to write software for an ATM. I was so bored and not challenged, I decided that if that’s what life as an engineer was like, I didn’t want any part of it, so I dropped out soon after.” However, she continued to work on projects she found interesting. By 1993 she was online and building web sites, and has been developing web apps ever since. </p>

				<h4>Tip #4: Love the Error</h4>
				<img src = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/codementor_content/2016-Jan-week1/embrace.gif" alt="Tip #3 Photo" width="470" height="313"/>
				<p>As a beginner you’ll likely be mired in bugs. If you feel intimidated by all the red, you’re not alone. Ross Chapman, a UX Engineer who coded for Zendesk and now works at ScienceExchange, admits to being a scared developer when he first started out. “I didn’t have the patience because I wasn’t ready to love the challenge of fixing things. But that’s pretty much where all my really bad habits come from.” With that said, Ross urges beginners to embrace errors as crucial learning moments.</p>
				<p>Since you’ll be debugging for life, you should get used to errors and learn to recognize the error messages. “Being able to quickly parse and understand error messages will save you a lot of time and get you a long way,” says Jack Franklin, author of “Beginning jQuery”. Jack also recommends beginners to make an attempt at fixing problems on their own at first. “The fact you’ve tried will be very much appreciated by the person you’re asking for help.”</p>
				<p>When hitting a wall when debugging, Lee Byron, co-contributor to Facebook’s React, personally attempts to understand what’s going on by making ample usage of the debugger tools. “Once I understand exactly what is happening – step by step, then I can compare that to what I expected to happen and isolate the surprising parts and see where my assumptions were wrong or how some code led to the surprising situation.” Errors aren’t limited to bugs, however. Sometimes, you make bad decisions such as using the wrong data structure. According to Mike, getting burned by those bad decisions will eventually help you learn when it’s reasonable to use certain design patterns.</p>
