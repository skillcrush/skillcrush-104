			<h4>It can be SCARY!</h4>
			<p>Yes it can be scary to try something completely different. But you know what! Don't let your fear rule you and drive you away from your goal and keep you from succeeding. Coding is not easy it takes time, patience and determination. There is much to learn and you'll never stop learning. </p>

			<h4>I've Never Tried Coding Before</h4>
			<p>I never tried coding before either. I worked as a Medical Assistant but now I am a stay at home mom. But I wanted a career that would allow me to be flexible and not hold me back. With coding I can eventually do that and more. I started the Wordpress Bootcamp in October and will be finished with Front-End Developer in December '16. Then I will start Wordpress in January '17</p>

			<p>You can specialize in different languages with coding such as Ruby, Rails and Python. Also there are many careers that you can choose from Visual or Web Designer, Developer, specialize in Front, Back End and Wordpress.</p>

			<p>Also don't forget to reach out and connect with other newbies. Stay active Google Groups, schedule office hours and follow other developers and designers on Twitter. My advice is to stay positive, continue to focus on your learning, plan your study schedule. And please don't give up. If I can do it so can you. Go for it! </p>
