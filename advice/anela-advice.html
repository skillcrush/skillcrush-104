			<h4> Who took my Job? </h4>
			<p> If you've been watching season three of Silicon Valley, you'll know that the Pied Piper team outsourced part of their workload to coders from around the world. A neat concept, but they ultilately did it to cut costs. </p>
			<p>The point is that, if you can learn to code online, someone in a third world country has probably already learned to do it and taught their entire village for free.</p>
			<p>Sure, learning to code might be great now, but in a decade (or less) you might be the one complaining about you job being outsourced to a foreign country. Just Sayin.</p>
