			<h4>Anyone can code! But...</h4>
			<p>It's also very hard. It takes patience.</p>

			<p>Remember to ask for help. Others have gone before you on this journey and you shouldn't be alone.</p>

			<h4>When nothing is working...</h4>
			<p>Take breaks! When something isn't working and you've tried literally everything, step away for a bit. You'll be amazed at what pops out at you quickly with fresh eyes.</p>

			<p>Look at sample code from past projects. How is yours different?</p>

			<p>Find new friends in the community. Growing your community gives you more places to turn for help.</p>
