			<h4>One day at a time.</h4>
			<p>Trying to add learning a new language into your busy schedule can get overwhelming. Just try to understand one lesson at a time. Come back to it if you need to. Don't put to much pressure on yourself to undertand everything right away. Take good notes and review the handy cheat sheets. Learn in your own time.  </p>

			<h4>Take a break and come back to your work.</h4>
			<p>Sometimes, when you're brain and eyes are tired it is hard to catch your mistakes. If you take a break and come back to the project later, you might see a simple mistake that you couldn't see when you were tired or frustrated. Correcting one word or missing symbol can magically make everything work correctly!</p>
