			<h4>Follow Through</h4>
			<p>You chose to change your life, you chose to work your ass off to learn an entirely new field and enter the workforce you didn't previously belong to. So fucking do it! Don't make excuses. Yes, you have screaming children, a S.O. with needs, a home to keep up, sweet 8 hours of sleep and a full time job, but if you want change there will be sacrifices. Just tough it up and fucking DO IT!! Don't give up. It's going to be really hard. But there is hope, help and support. Take advantage of it and never give up!</p>

			<p>Remember, this is temporary. You will come out on the other side of this amazing education programa and tool empowered and knowledgable. You may get less sleep, work less hours at your 9-5, miss the evening netflix and chill here and there. But if you stay diligent and truely devote yourself to the allocated time for SKillcrush, you will be moving on, before you know it, to bigger and better things. </p>

			<h4>Find a Mentor</h4>
			<p>There will be times when you feel defeated; when you feel incompetent; when you ask yourself "what the fuck am I doing". Those times are great times to take respite in a mentor. Find someone who is in the field who can encourage you to pursue this crazy adventure when the going gets tough. We all need encouragement and affirmation. A mentor can help hold you accountable. Set goals for yourself and speak them aloud for your mentor to shame you when you fail (okay, so not shame, but you know...)

			<p>Jess, you can still do this! Find a mentor and use them. I know you and you are a putz. You have a million excuses, and yes, they are good excuses. But that's not enough. Help someone help you.</p>
