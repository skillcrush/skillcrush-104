			<h4>Go back to elementary school</h4>
			<p>Coding? What does that mean? where do I begin? Elementary school of course! I found a free code.org conference on how to teach elementary students how to code. I loved it and my students loved it. I completed all of their lessons on code.org and used a lot of their unplugged lessons in my classroom. Mastering all the elementary code lessons might sound silly but it really helped me understand what it means to code!</p>

			<h4>Hot & Cheap</h4>
			<p>Take all the FREE courses you can! Codeacademy and Dash on general assembly are a great start! When you are ready sign up for skillcrush's front end development class. Skillcrush is finacially the best option for a beginner! Especially if you haven't decided if this is the right career for you yet.  </p>

			<h4>Get frustrated</h4>
			<p>There are times I have wanted to give up! I get stuck on a project and think "I am not smart enough to understand this", that's when I take a break. Later on I ask for help, google everything, and in many cases start over from stratch. </p>

			<div class ="quote">"Frustration, although quite painful at times, is a very positive and essential part of success.""
