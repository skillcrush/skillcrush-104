				<h4>Deciding How to Learn</h4>
				<p>Try not to spend too much time trying to pick which courses or classes or videos or whatever you're going to do. Just start! You'll figure out what works best for you with time.</p>

				<p>There are a million coding tutorials, schools and courses out there. I got stuck trying to find the "best" one until I realized it was hindering my actual learning. As in, I was spending all my time trying researching and not actually making a the career change I wanted. Make an educated guess and dive in! Coding is awesome and the sooner you get started the better.</p>

				<h4>Choosing What Language to Learn</h4>
				<p>I also spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was the "best" language to learn. Or thinking I could learn all of them. Or trying to pick the one that could make me the most money. I would tell past me to "take a bite" of all of them and see which one tastes the best, then focus on that one and get really good at that one. There's so much coding to be done that you really can make it with the thing that speaks to you.</p>

				<p>That being said, I'd also recommend starting with a strong knowledge of HTML and CSS. They are the foundation of the web. I know people who glossed over them thinking they were not advanced enough. I've been told in interviews that knowing the CSS "box model" (not a complex concept) has put me ahead of other who didn't spend the time on it.</p>

			<div class="everything">
				<h4>You'll Never Know Everything and Neither Will Anyone Else!</h4>
				<p>This is actually awesome! If you love learning, then this is the field for you. Never be intimiated just because you don't know something. Everyone is learning constantly. Things are evolving so quickly that it doesn't matter if you don't know it. Google is everybody's friend, from novice to seasoned "expert".</p>

				<p>In fact, I had to use the browser Inspect tool while making this advice column! Don't let not knowing everything get in your way! You can do this!</p>
