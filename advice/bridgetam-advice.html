			<h4>Don't be afraid to ask for help!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming, there can be a lot of confusion and problems with your code.</p>

			<p>Ask for help! It's always helpful when another set of eyes can look through your code and pinpoint problems with it. I was stuck on an error with my code, but finally asked a programmer friend and they were able to help me see what I did wrong.</p>

			<p>Not only did they help me fix the problem, they explained what was wrong and how to avoid it in the future.</p>
