			<h4>Starting out is overwhelming</h4>
			<p>There is so much information that it is sort of terrifying to know where to start. Just begin.</p>
			<h4>Google is your friend</h4>
			<p>Google the sh*t out of all questions, thoughts and ideas even if you don't fully understand the answers. People in the tech community are actually super helpful.</p>
			<h4>Frustration is inevitable</h4>
			<p>You will get so angry that you may throw your mouse across the room. You will hate that you that you don't know enough or can't find the problem or ask yourself, "why the HELL won't this work?!!!!" Take some time away from your computer, go for a swim, walk your dog, see a friend, have a glass of wine and then look at the issue again with fresh eyes.</p>
