						<p>Just like the way you may dip a toe to test the temperature of the water, you should consider doing the same thing with coding -- from a non-metaphorical standpoint, of course. Don't try to invest a lot of time and money into coding without first seeing if you even like it. Coding is not for everyone, it takes a lot of patience, trial-and-error, and frustration ... but it's not all negative.</p>

						<p>Coding is challenging and if you like challenges then coding just might be for you. There are several free ways to test yourself such as <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" class="paragraph-links">Codecademy</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" class="paragraph-links">W3Schools</a>, <a href="https://learn.skillcrush.com/skillcrush-10-day-bootcamp/" target="_blank" class="paragraph-links">Skillcrush 10-Bootcamp</a>, and a multitude of tutorials on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=web+tutorials" target="_blank" class="paragraph-links">Youtube</a>. Choose one and see if it's something you like. If you crave more, then coding just might be for you. If you can't make heads or tails out of these html tags or find it boring, then you're probably better off searching for something you do like.</p>

						<p>Coding can be relaxing and enjoyable as well as rewarding. There's nothing like that feeling of accomplishment when you finally get a piece of code working the way you intended after hours or even days of wracking your brain. If, after that, you still can't wait to take on another coding challenge, then you're definitely a coder.</p>

						<p>If there's one thing I wish I knew before I learned to code, it would be to learn one thing at-a-time. When I first started coding, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Well, that was good and all, but then I jumped into learning PHP while at the same time taking on Java and Visual Basic. You know what I learned? I learned that I would have learned more had I learned just one programming language well, first.</p>

						<p>You see, by trying to learn multiple programming languages simultaneously, I was basically learning the syntax for the different languages rather than how to actually put the langauages to good use. Had I learned one language well, I would've been able to mainly focus on the syntax of the others because the basic functionality is the same. But since I did not go that route, I had to go back and re-learn one language well. Although it's rewarding now, it would have saved me a lot of time had I learned the easier way the first time.</p>

						<p>Piggybacking off of the last advice, this one still catches me off-guard sometimes.</p>

						<p>Nowadays, you will find a plethora of advice about what you should learn in the coding world; this is especially prevalent in the web developer community. Should you learn jQuery or Angular? React or Express? PHP or Python? And the list goes on and on. With all of those choices, it's no surprise that many coders get overwhelmed. So what is a coder to do?</p>

						<p>First, don't get overwhelmed by trends. You will find that many employers will expect coders to have knowledge with multiple languages or frameworks and many companies tend to follow what's popular at the time. However, don't focus so much on trying to learn everything under the sun. You will find that a lot of the languages and frameworks do the same things. So pick one of each and learn them well, then when you decide to transition to the others you will already have a good foundation and the learning won't take as long.</p>

						<p>As mentioned above, "many employers will expect coders to have knowledge with multiple languages or frameworks". Regardless of how many years of experience you may have, rarely will you find employers looking for a web developer or programmer who only knows one or two things. Most times you will find a list of several languages and frameworks that the company is looking for. In addition, they may want knowledge of databases and testing environments and of course they want several years of experience in those areas. So the more things you can learn, the more valuable you will be to a potential employer.</p>
