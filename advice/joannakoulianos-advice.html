			<p>The most important piece of advice I could give to anyone who is starting out where I was at the beginning of this year is to stick with it. As with anything from working out to eating right to learning to play an instrument to learning to code, consistency is key. It's OK if you get home from work and are too exhausted to code one day, but the more days you skip, the harder you have to work to catch up and the more likely you are to give up. Plus, for me, I've found that doing small chunks on a daily basis is more effective than having a marathon coding session one day out of the week. This is why Skillcrush has been so effective for me.</p>
