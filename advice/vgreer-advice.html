			<h4>Google is your new best friend!</h4>
			<p>when you get stuck (and you will - everybody does), try searching with Google for the answer.  You'd be amazed at some of the information you can find.  For example, when I was having trouble with flexbox, I googled "make flexbox divs the same size" and actually got some good results!  Even if you think you can't pin down the issue enough to write a good query, try it and see what comes up.</p>

			<h4>Never give up. Never surrender.</h4>
			<p>It's going to be hard sometimes.  You're learning something new, and that can be very difficult and sometimes exasperating.  But if you keep on working at it, you will eventually get it.</p>

			<h4>Ask for help when you need it.</h4>
			<p>And when you're at your wits' end, don't be afraid to ask for help.  Search for the answer yourself, but if you can't find it, reach out to your classmates or the instructors at Skillcrush.</p>
