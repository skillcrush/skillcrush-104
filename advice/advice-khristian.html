			<h4>Practice makes perfect</h4>
			<p>The best way to get comfortable with coding, and therefore confident and productive, is to practice practice <strong>practice</strong>!!!!! Use jBin to practice writing Javascript (this is how I learn and practice writing methods).</p>

			<p>Practice can also come with refreshers! I am doing this project as a refresher, especially because I struggled with the forking/merging aspect on this assignment. I am now trying to get hired in a remote tech role, and a major function will most likely involve Github. So here I am, doing this course like I haven't before to get even better at writing code and forking and merging to a repository.</p>

			<h4>Sometimes you break it, and you want to buy it.</h4>
			<p>Feel really confident in your skills so far? I bet you don't feel confident enough to break your code and try to fix it! Good news if you feel that way- you should <strong>definitely</strong> break your code (just remember to save a copy, and branch off the master first).</p>
