			<h2>Pretend Like All Your Assignments Are Being Seen ;)</h2>
				<p> Your work will be highly visible soon enough.
				</p>
			<H2>Make a List of Past Accomplishments</H2>
				<p>Keep handy something to remind you of other times in life that you succeeded at tough challenges.</p>

			<h2> Focus on What You Do Know</h2>
				<p>There's a lot to learn and thinking about everything you don't understand too frequently creates fear and frustration. Think about the tools you 
				do have to work with. Take the steps to learn more, but don't forget how far you have traveled and what you have to work with that you didn't a 
				few months or weeks ago.

			<h2>If It's Not Fun, It's Not Worth Doing!</h2>
				<p> Yes, learning to code is hard work. It can be frustrating at times. We all have to do things we don't like sometimes, but you should 
				be enjoying some part of this! Or it's not a good fit for you. 
				</p>
			<H2> Be Still for Hours, and then move!</H2>
				<p> 
				After sitting in front of the computer for hours you need to do something for your body!
				Walk around in fresh air and sunshine. Jog. Yoga. Or just some gentle stretching near the desk. You 
				get the idea.

			<h2> Remember Thomas Edison!</h2>
			<h5>Two Great Quotes:</h5>
				<p>“Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration.” <br>
