			<h4>Tenacity is your friend</h4>
			<p>I started this tech journey a little over a month ago. Other than knowing the the basics of web surfing and saving files, I KNEW NOTHING.</p>
			<p>It's also worth mentioning that I'm a "Xennial", which is the awkwardly named subgeneration that falls in between Gen X and Millenial. Meaning, I had to be introduced to computers as a child. While not native to technology, I still can eventually figure some things out.</p>
			<p>Maybe you're like me and you feel you're at a slight disadvantage due to age/having a non-tech background.</p>
			<p>There will be times that you'll want to give up. When this happens, <em>BACK AWAY FROM THE COMPUTER,</em> and go outside. Or get some sleep. You'll come back with fresh eyes and a fresh perspective.</p>
			<p>And remember, Google is your friend.</p>

				<div id="frustration">
			<h4>Embrace the Frustration</h4>
			<p>If you're like me, everything with coding/learning new concepts in tech comes, well, NOT easy. Somebody could spoon feed me what to do, but I find that sweating through the many many (MANY) missteps solidifies the information in my head. I figure out for myself the how and the why. Slowly. Painfully. But it gets done.</p>

			<p>I tell myself this mantra, about every 5 seconds or so: "If being in the technology field were easy, everyone would be doing it and then it wouldn't be in demand nor would it pay well."</p>

			<p>Because the knowledge is hard won, you'll get a rush of dopamine to the brain when you refresh your page and voila! The page did what you wanted it to! So rewarding!</p>
			<p>Think of all the character you're building. I feel like there's a pun in there somewhere. </p>
