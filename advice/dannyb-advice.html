		        <p>Your brain can only retain so much information at a time.  Trying to learn a programming language by spending hours and hours in a single sitting, reading, practicing, debugging, etc... will work against you.   Limit your study time to smaller chunks.  I find that spending no more than 2-3 hours a day, with 15 to 25 minute breaks every 45 to 60 minutes works for me.

		        <p>I didn't always do this.  When I first started re-learning how to code, I would try and code/learn for hours upon hours at a time.  Taking breaks only to eat or use the bathoom (we only rent water).  In time I realized that I wasn't learning as much as I thought I had been.  I knew I was reading all these books and doing all this practice, but I wasn't really moving forward.  I then realized that it was because I was overloading my brain, and thus not retaining nearly as much as I thought I would.</p>

		        <p>So, give yourself a break.  Don't try so hard, and relax.  You'll learn and retain more by being nicer to your brain.</p>
