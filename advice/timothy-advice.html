			<h4>You will run into problems but don't give up!</h4>
			<p>Before taking this course I was already familiar with CSS and HTML but I had never learned a programming language before.</p>
			<p>Naturally I ran into a number of problems and even though I got frustrated I just kept saying "don't give up, don't give up."</p>
			<p>Evenutally, I solved the problems by either asking for help or researching for solutions on my own.</p>
			<p>So whatever you do, don't give up!</p>
