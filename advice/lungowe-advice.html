			<h4>Taking the first step is all it takes!</h4>
			<p>So I finally took the plunge to learn how to code. After years of avoiding it like the plague, believing that I wasn't smart enough to do, I've realised that all I needed was to take the first step. And I'm glad I did!!</p>

			<p>What inspired me the most was Adda's story of how she first got started in Tech. After I read her story, I immediately signed up for the Skillcrush Front-End Developer blueprint and I haven't looked back since.</p>

			<h4>Fight the Fear</h4>
			<p>Fear is inevitable as one embarks on a new journey but don't let it hold you back. Take a glimpse at how far you've come from and what you knew then and use that to compare the skills that you've acquired in the present. Naturally, you've come a long way. Always remember that and use it as a fuel to drive you even further.</p>
