				<h4>OMG, learning something new is so freaking hard!</h4>
				<p>Seriously. It's insanely more difficult than when you were younger (I'm pretty sure brain science backs that up). I'm learning three things right now&mdash;coding, surfing, and Spanish&mdash;and I'm going bananas! <span>So do yourself a favor and give yourself a hearty pat on the back or thumbs up in the mirror.</span> You totally deserve it. You're brave and smart and persistent and doing something that&mdash;whether it's learning a new skill or career-overhauling&mdash;so many people think about, but so few have the courage to do. <span>Way to go, you!</span></p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="dont">
				<h4>Don't hesitate&mdash;not even for a half-second&mdash;to ask for help.</h4>
				<p>Whether it's the Googs or the amazing Skillcrush community or a trusted friend or colleague, don't be afraid to reach out! First of all, people want to help and give advice and talk about what they know and love. You know you do. :) But more importantly, there are <span>massive</span> benefits to asking for help. It's great practice for you, since it makes you vulnerable (and not just professionally &ndash; because if you're at all like me, you've got other stuff you need to get vulnerable about!); you build your network, not to mention your crew of supportive peeps; and you get to where you want to go, usually faster and easier. <span>So reach out, my friend!</span></p>
			</div>
			<div class="take">
				<h4>Take care of yo'self!</h4>
				<p>We could all use more of this, am I right?!? Take breaks, get social (and I don't mean media-wise), spend time with animals, move your bod, eat good food, smile &ndash; all that great stuff. Because if you remember numero uno, <span>you are killing it these days!</span> And you deserve the best for yourself. And you know your product will be better for it!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="huge">
				<h4><span>&#10084;</span> Huge hugs to you! <span>&#10084;</span></h4>
			</div>
			<div class="ps">
				<p>(P.S. I literally just this minute Googled how to make those cute hearts in HTML! The power of asking others for help...Gotta &#10084; it!)</p>
