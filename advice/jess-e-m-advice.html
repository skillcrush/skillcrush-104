							<h4>"Fail and fail often"</h4>
							<p>I've never been too sure about this in real life, as it appeared to be too much of a tidy quote for people to engage with it as advice.</p>
							<p>However, I think it's the right approach to programming. As long as your versioning practices are robust, go crazy and get things wrong to get them right. I'm certainly learning through trial and error!</p>

							<h4>Find a mentor and latch onto them like a barnacle</h4>
							<p>Take the metaphor with a pinch of salt, but finding on-hand help has been very useful in my experience. Luckily there are plenty of people to ask where I work, and I can Slack them with all my questions.</p>
							<p>If you don't have handy colleagues, try searching online or in your area for bootcamps, meetups, or even university students willing to tutor. (Make sure your mentor feels appreciated!)</p>
					</div>
					<div class="advice-container">
							<h4>Keep learning!</h4>
							<p>Unfortunately when things get difficult, you've got to keep going and not give up. It's moments like that which teach you how to look at problems differently and will be valuable experience for your career as a developer!</p>
