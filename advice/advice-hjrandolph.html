<h2 class = "subheader"> and I have some advice for you!</h2>

			<h4>These things take time</h4>
			<p>I have been working at this class for a lot longer than expected. It's a three month blueprint: I should totally be done now!
			But life happens. People get sick. Stuff pops up. Don't give up because things go a little pear shaped. Use the unexpected nonsense
			 to help you learn how to navigate the choppy waters of life.</p>

			<p>This stuff is hard. Most things worth doing are. Had I given up when I ran into trouble, I certainly wouldn't be advising you to be as bullheaded, stubborn, and willful as I am. 
			Those socially dubious traits are not handicaps: they are measures of determination and grit. </p>

			<h4>Dream Big</h4>
			<p>We are here learning to code. We are learning new languages. We are grasping at something out of reach. We need to keep it up.</p>

			<p>I have dreamt for my whole life about all the things I wanted to do. Who I wanted to be. Somewhere in my twenties, I got discouraged. I doubted my abilities and the probability of me Making It.</p>
			<p>I started thinking small instead of Dreaming Big. Instead of thinking, "When this novel is written..." I started thinking, "If I ever finish this story..." I was less interested in how I was going to better my life than I was in making sure today was better than yesterday.</p>

			<p>Living in the moment is excellent, and I was doing that to an extent. But I was also sacrificing hopes and dreams because I was afraid of failing. I should have embraced failure: we learn what not to do again by failing when we do it the first (or second) time. Code will choke on you. Look at it and work out why. Don't give up on it or on yourself.</p>
