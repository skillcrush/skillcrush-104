			<h4>Get real projects to practice on!</h4>
			<p>Even if you feel you don't know enough to create something real, go for it! That would be the only way you will really process all the new amount of information you are learning.</p>

			<p>While doing this, be also preper to have lots of questions and be very very slow, and this is ok. There will always be the next project that will show how much you have improved from the previous one.</p>
