			<h4>One day at a time!</h4>
			<p>When learning development, it often feels like there are too many options, too many things to learn, too many questions, that the idea of doing anything at all is just too overwhelming.</p>

			<p>So I have found that when learning development, it's best to take the process one day at a time. Start with one lesson, one language, one skill and build on that each day. If you think too far ahead, you'll get scared or intimated or overwhelmed. So start small.</p>
