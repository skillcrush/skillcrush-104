			<h4>Take Breaks!</h4>
			<p>Learning anything new is challenging, and it gets frustrating and overwhelming! Even if you are on a time crunch, take a break. Walk away and try again in 15 minutes, an hour or maybe the next day if possible.</p>

			<p>Walking away is not quitting, as long as you return. Resting your eyes and brain is helpful for finding what you didn't see before and pushing forward!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="advice-2">
			<h4>Resources & time management!</h4>
			<p>There are so many free and attainable resources to help learn almost any task these days, take advantage of them! Search the web, read answers, try rememdies and learn the hard way. You are more apt to remember something you had to figure out yourself.</p>

			<p>Set mini goals when you sit down at the computer. Either give yourself an hour, or tell yourself you need to finish 3 tasks that day. Something that gives you a deadline and time frame to work with, it can be helpful and good practice for the real world!</p>

			<p>The tech industry is ever-changing, so don't obsess over minor details. Do your best, make it functional and complete, have someone review it and complete the project, don't wait!</p>
