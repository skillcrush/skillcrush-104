			<h4>Never Give Up!</h4>
			<p>When I first started coding...learning the basics, I was very overwhelmed with all the information that I needed to learn. I stuck with it and took it a step at a time.</p>

			<p>I don't think I will ever learn it all, but I like to think that I have learned a lot in the short time I've been studying. I look back almost a year ago and never thought I would get excited over getting a new code book or learning a new tricks.</p>

			<h4>Impressed Yourself</h4>
			<p>When I think about what I've learned I'm actually impressed with myself, because I never thought I would be coding and liking it.</p>

			<p>There are somethings that are harder for me and I need to work on i.e. javascript. The best advice I have, is don't give up or give in. Take a break if you need to walk away for awhile, but don't give up. If you have trouble in some areas, go back to it later with a fresh set of eyes and perspective and it will start to creep in.</p>

			<p>I understand there is always more to learn and technology is always changing, but just hang in there and soon you'll be coding with confidence.</p>
