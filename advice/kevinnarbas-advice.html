			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>Just go through with it and trust the system!!</p>

			<h4>Stick with it!</h4>
			<p>Dont give up and code every single day. A "oh I'll just take a one day break" will make it easier on you to skip more and more days which will prolong learning making your time as a coder that much shorter.  So just push through the tough times and youll be up and happy as a full on coder. </p>
