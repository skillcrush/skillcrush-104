			<h4>Always watch on yourself</h4>
			<p>Things are new for you and you can thing that's it complicated but trully it is not. Do you remeber when you were just started you were confused and lost. I thought that you are not smart enough. And now, look at you! You know a lot of cool things. Now you CAN write a web app or mobile app. Now you CAN code.</p>

			<p>You thought that it's going to be complicated for you but it is NOT. When you will feel that you are not smart enough just deeply breate, calm, close your eyes and remeber yourself year ago or two. How grow you up. Ask yourself what do you know now and what you did't know then.</p>

			<h4>Always have fun with code</h4>
			<p>Don't be so serious. Look we can code and make fun. Making websites or creating web apps you are always haveng fun.</p>
			<h4>Here is the list why coding is fun</h4>
				<div class="latkins-advice-list">
					<ul>
						<li>You learn new technology, every tiume when you're doing a new project</li>
						<li>You communicate with new people. You are making a network with people from all over the world</li>
						<li>You are making your brain works and this is awesome!</li>
						<li>And last but not least, you can <strong>study all life long.</strong></li>
					</ul>
				</div>

			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
