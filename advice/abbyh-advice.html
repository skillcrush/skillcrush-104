			<h4>Keep On Keeping On!</h4>
			<p>Since most of the information you will be learning is brand spanking new, it is important to keep pushing yourself to try to understand when things may not seem to make a whole lot of sense. By being persistent and not giving up, you will end up yielding the best results. What doesn't challenge you, doesn't change you. </p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
