			<h4>JUST READ!</h4>
			<p>You have to read! There is no better advice I can give above this, seriously! Sometimes when we're learning something new we get overwhelmed with the information flood and we panic. However, this is not condusive to good retention and progress. So, do yourself a favor and slow down and READ. The information is all there sometimes it's not perfectly in front of your face, but if you read through the data you have, you'll find it!</p>

			<p>Now, what if once you've "read" the information, you're still LOST! yep you guessed it! RE-READ! Sometimes you may have to take information in more than once for it to make sense to you and you to retain it fully, but that's okay. It's also PERFECTLY NORMAL!!! you're not alone. we all have to re-read and reevaluate and revisit new information in order for all the details to stick, the important part is that you give yourself the time you need to do whatever it takes to get it! No shame!</p>

			<h4>One Step At A Time</h4>
			<p>Try to take one step at a time when your learning all of this amazing coding world. It can be a lot to absorb and sometimes we can get excited and ahead of ourselves. Trust me though it's better to slow down and take one step at a time. That way your retention rises and your focus helps you to be more methodical in your procedures (which is extremely helpful when you have to make sure you're taking all the right steps and your code works properly)!</p>

			<p>It's especially important to slow down and take each step one at a time when your feeling confused about something. If when you read through all the directions it doesn't feel like it's making a lot of sense, then you re-read the directions and it still doesn't seem to make much sense, This is the perfect time to take the first step! Start at the begining, read the first step ONLY, and complete it! Then look at step number two, and complete it. Keep going until you've finished the task entirely, I bet when you're done you understand what you did, why, and how! It works for me everytime I do it! Promise!</p>

			<p>Most importantly, be patient with youreself and DON'T compare youreslf to others. We all learn differently and we all learn at different paces, and thats okay! Thats what makes us uniquly qualified for our future dream jobs! If we were all exactly the smae coders, we would have trouble getting the unique jobs we love, and the industry would suck a little, don't you think? You're you, and thats perfect, so ask questions when you need to and take whatever time you nedd to get it done and feel good doing it! :) </p>
