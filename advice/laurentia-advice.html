			<h4>Aladin</h4>

			<p>Do you remember Aladin the Disney movie in the late 1990's - oh of course you don't you were just a baby. If you did manage to watch it somewhere in your childhood, do you remember the song - "A whole new world"?</p>

            <p>Well that is what this feels like and just like the lyrics say "don't you dare close your eyes!"</p>

            <h4>You found the magical genie</h4>
            <p>Well we can't all have a Robin Williams (RIP) guiding us along the way but I am sure you have noticed by now you are your own magical genie. You have it all inside of you - you can do it! It is up to you to do it, though! Take breaks and Rome was not built in a day so pace yourself. THIS IS NOT A RACE!! Somethings you will get without much trying and other things will throw you off balance but you will get there.</p>

            <p>Just like a baby learning everything in the world - so will you. Learn to talk, crawl, walk, run, jump, climb and skip. These are all things you learned to do because you were born curious and wanted to stretch your abilities. So will you learn to conquer this?  </p>
