			<h4>Approach Git at Terminal Velocity!</h4>
			<p>When you first start out, you may feel like you are just blindly following instructions and copying and pasting commands in the terminal. Don't fret! It will all come together as you continue to practice. Most of these things won't make sense, and they shouldn't at this poin!</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a sign that you are paying attention and are thinking about the process</p>

			<h4>Keep going!</h4>
			<p>Once you've completed you've first assignment, keep going! Come up with a list of dummy projects to work on.</p>
