			<h4>Find a Supportive Community</h4>
				<p>
					When I first started coding, I could not find a supportive place where I could seek advice and find encouragement.  That experience deterred me from wanting to code, so I stopped. Within the past couple years, I have seen a rise in groups where women can come together for the advice, encouragement, and support that I was seeking years ago.  These groups are one of the reasons why I continue my coding journey.  Seeing people in the place where I would like to be gives me hope that I can soon be there.
				</p>
			<h4>Don't Give Up</h4>
				<p>
					This is important.  Sometimes, you will be frustrated when your code breaks, and you can't find that missing closing tag or semicolon. I've almost given up, or took a break from coding, and I regret it.  I always come back to it.
				</p>

			<h4>Google is Your Friend</h4>
				<p>
					Google is pretty much all-knowing, so when you get stuck, please use it. 99.9% of the questions you need to ask have probably already been asked and answered.
