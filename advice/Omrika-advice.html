			<h4>DONT BE DISCOURAGED</h4>
			<div><p>When learning to program you dont really know what you have to learn, you ask yourself questions like "where am i suppose to start?" or like myself, you're shy when asking for help, afraid that you may ask a stupid question and feel like you aren't smart enough or good enough. Dont be discouraged, i'm a newbie and a few months ago i didnt know half the stuff i know now. You'll look back and realize you've made progress! Keep working it at it. Believe in yourself.<p><div>
