			<h4>Score a quick win right now</h4>
			<p>Confidence holds coding students back more than anything else. Get a boost by starting with something easy. Code.org has Star Wars and Minecraft hour of code curriculum designed for kids. Even if you’re an adult, it’s a great way to prove to yourself
				that you can do it.</p>


			<h4>The best way to learn how to code is to code</h4>
			<p>Lots of students start by reading books. It’s OK to go that route — that’s how I learned to code when I was just getting started, but if you really want to get off on the right foot, start out with some exercises.</p>


			<h4>Read Blogs.</h4>
			<p>I may be biased, but JavaScript Scene is a great blog to subscribe to. I’m a fan of 2ality as well — a great way to stay on top of what’s coming next in the JavaScript specification.</p>
