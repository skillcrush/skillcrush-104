			<h4>Have a growth mindset, not a fixed one.</h4>
			<p>Everyone starts off as newbies. Steve Jobs knew nothing about how computers worked, when he was a baby.</p>

			<p>Even if you aren't now, you can be the next Ada Lovelace, with time, effort, and a name change.</p>

			<h4>Nothing is impossible.</h4>
			<p>Treat everything like a fun challenging puzzle -- don't know how that Javascript works? Google it. Not sure how to fix that error? Google. Need advice on your Tinder affairs? Google.</p>

			<p>Google knows everything, until it doesn't.</p>
