			<h4>Focus On One Thing At A Time</h4>
			<p>When you first start learning code you will have the urge to learn multiple languages at a time.  Take small steps everyday to learn just one. </p>

			<p>Focus on mastering a language.  Once you do that, It'll be a lot easier to take on another one.</p>

			<h4>It Will Get Confusing But Never Give Up</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>There will be times where you will doubt yourself.  But remember that we all go though these stages.  Keep pushing forward and you will succeed.</p>
			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
