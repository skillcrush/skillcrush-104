		<h1>Hi my name is Josh and I have some advice for you!</h1>
	</header>

	<section>
		<div class="advice">
			<h1>Believe In Yourself!</h1>
			<p>When you are learning something brand new and fairly complicated, like coding, it is extremely easy
			to tell yourself things like: "I'm just not cut out for this stuff," or "This is just crazy! What am I 
			thinking?" or "I should just stick to what I know."</p>
			<p>Well, I believe that everyone who ever began learning anything challenging has had those same thoughts 
			and said those same things to themself.<span>You are no different</span> than they are!  You have to remember
			that every time you sit down to study and/or practice, you are making progress.  And, eventually, you<span> WILL</span>
			 get to where you really want to be.</p>
			 <p>The difference between you, right now, and the people that are doing what you want to be doing is that they 
			 persevered through those self-defeating behaviors because they believed in themselves; and they knew that with 
			 time and effort, they would be successful. So, it becomes a choice, albeit a difficult one sometimes: Do I say
			 f**k it and give up and be disappointed with the rest of my life?  or Do I have faith in my efforts despite the 
			 sometimes frustrating learning process?</p>
			 <h2>If it were easy, everyone would be doing it!</h2>
