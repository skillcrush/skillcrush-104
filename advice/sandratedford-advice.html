            <h3>Cracking The Code</h3>
            <p>Wow! If someone had told me I would be coding websites ten years ago and on top of that, <em>actually understand coding languages,</em> I would have looked at them sideways. Yet here I am "Crushin It!". I love learning how to code and look forward to learning more. The decision to enroll in classes for coding did not come easy. To say that I was confused is putting it lightly. I took a class in HTML back in 1999 to learn because I heard great things about the world wide web and opportunities in tech. I'm naturally drawn to vivid and interesting graphics so I thought this should be worth my while.</p>

            <p>Although I found the web development interesting, I felt very lost in class and quickly lost interst. You see, learning how to code is alot like learning a second language. Yet the desire to learn web development kept knawing at me over the years. Something about web developement just felt right. And with that said, I knew I was on the right path and things became much clearer. Its been said, <strong>Clarity,</strong> is a sign that you are heading in the right direction.</p>

            <p>I realized after visiting Khemet (Egypt), that just as the ancient Khemetians built the great pyramids in Khemet (Egypt), they were very clear and precise in building this great structure. In the same way, things became much clearer when I decided to embrace the desire to be creative.</p>

            <h3>The Best Decision</h3>
			<p>I have to admit I was a little aphrehensive about going down this new path in my career. In fact, I erroneously thought that tech was for anyone born before 1990. Here I was thinking, I was to mature <em>("notice I did'nt say old")</em>, yet I started reading alot of articles online from sites like wired.com and skillshare.com and most of the articles were written by tech professionals who were much older than I was. I thought <strong>"what the heck" just go for it.</strong></p>

            <p>I dived right in and embraced the decision to learn how to code. And I must say it has been the best decision I've ever made. I can really see myself as a tech professional.</p>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
			</p>
			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
