			<h2>Check your Work</h2>
			<p>Computers are dumb and you are smart...but you will feel dumb if a teeny tiny mistake messes up your entire code!  Check, double check,
				and when all else fails, ask someone else to look over your code. They may catch what you missed...and even some things you didn't notice!
				Don't sweat it...typos happen!</p>

			<h2>Don't Expect Immediate Perfection</h2>
			<p>You're learning a new skill.  It may be totally different from anything you've ever done before.  You'll probably suck to start with.  So
				did most people who had no idea what they were doing.  But you know what?  Pretty soon it's going to click...you'll get it...and you'll know
				so much more than everyone else!</p>

			<h2>Mondays Suck for Coding</h2>
			<p>At least they do for me.</p>

			<h2>Don't Try to Force it</h2>
			<p>Coding after dinner is a slog.  Don't force it...that's how mistakes happen.</p>
