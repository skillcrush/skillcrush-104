			<h4>Be cognisant of your learning and working style.</h4>
			<p>Every person has a specific learning and/or working style. It
				would be very beneficial to pinpoint what type of learner/worker you are.</p>

			<p>There is a trend toward "open" environments in both academic and professional environments.
				The goal is to foster more collaborative working relationships. Not everyone is able to be productive in such
				open environments. One who is easily distracted by the activities of others may not be able to learn as well,
				or produce their best work.</p>

			<p>I learned the hard way that I'm way more productive if I limit these distractions,
				and the open work environment is not the best for me. If you can pinpoint your style
				early, you'll save yourself a lot of time and energy.</p>
