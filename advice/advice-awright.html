			<h4>Don't let $$$ be the draw</h4>
			<p>I see so many people learn tech because they hear it pays well, and thst you can learn a skill and get that job without a degree. My advice is to make sure you enjoy what you are doing. It can be fascinating and tech seems to fit many personality types, so make sure you like what you are doing. 
            </p>


			<h4>Remember the "soft skills."</h4>
			<p>You can put the right skills on the wrong person and it be the wrong outcome. Build up your soft skills too! Team-work cooperation, patience, humility, and intergrity make all the difference in the world.</p>

            <h4>"In 100 Days, I will..."</h4>
            <p> Everyday, see where you are on your tech-journey. Every day, count down a day, and keep that motivation going. </p>
