<h1>Hi, I'm Alesa and here's my advice:</h1>

			<h4>Fellow coders are your best resource.</h4>
			<p>When you get caught up on something, don't be afraid to ask questions or look at the work of your peers. Looking at another person's working code can be a great way to solve a puzzle in your own work.</p>

			<h4>Practice a little bit every day.</h4>
			<p>Learning a programming language can be a lot like learning German or Spanish â€” you'll retain more if you speak your language a little bit every day, rather than cramming a month's worth of practice into one night.</p>
			
			<h4>Share the love.</h4>
			<p>Contributing to projects and teaching others new skills are perfect ways to keep practicing AND be an awesome human!</p>
