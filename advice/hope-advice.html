			<h4>Keep a notebook!</h4>
			<p>This can be an electronic document or an actual notebook. I like to have my little book close to write
				little notes to myself. Maybe its a reminder to look something up later or simply a line of code you want
				 to remember. You don't have to write everything down. just what you think you will want later.</p>

			<h4>Just keep coming back to it!</h4>
			<p>Sometimes your code just is not right. You will want to walk away and never look at it again. Often if
				you take a break and come back you can figure it out, or the computer will let go of past data and it
				will all just work.</p>

				<h1>Most important</h1>
				<h1>Don't give up!</h1>
