			<h4>Don't worry! You'll be okay.</h4>
			<p>Breathe. You need to do this first. And remember that all of us started here, staring at our computer screens, wondering what in the hell we got ourselves into.</p>

			<p>There will be times when you just finished something and you want to run around your house like you just finished a marathon. Take that victory lap because your next lesson will most likely be something you don't understand.</p>

			<h4>Have fun</h4>
			<p>Seriously, have fun. It'll be difficult to think that any of this can be fun but it really is.</p>

			<p>What improves this fun is getting to know people in the community.</p>

			<p>I followed Skillcrush on Twitter and Instagram and whenever they reposted someone, I went to that individual's page and read through their posts. Most likely, these people are following other coding related sources so it's easy to find other places to look. Also, interact with those people if you want to add something to their tweet/photo. We all like to collect resources!</p>
