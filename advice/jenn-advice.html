			<h4>Remember Your Why</h4>
			<p>When learning code, never forget your why. Why are you learning to code? What obstacles are you trying to get past?</p>
			<p>For me, I am learning how to code because I want to be able to spend more time with <a href="http://www.instagram.com/jenny.pancakes" target="_blank">my son, Beans</a>.</p>
			<h4>Persist</h4>
			<p>It isn't going to be easy all the time. It will take months or years before you feel fully comfortable with your new skills. But this level of discomfort is a good thing; it means you're learning and growing and bettering yourself as a developer.</p>
			<p>As soon as you start to feel static, then you've stopped growing. Keep moving. Persist. Stay uncomfortable.</p>
