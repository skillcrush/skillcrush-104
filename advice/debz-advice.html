			<h4>Feeling confused, lost, and dismayed? Yippee!!</h4>
			<p> That means one thing - you care about what your doing - which is the start of learning to get past the road blocks.</p>
			<p> I usually stop doing what I'm frustrated at and distract myself.</p>
			<p> Thats when I clean the bathroom sink or take out the recyclables or play coconut with Clover my dog...</p>
	<p>Then after twenty minutes of doing something that I can simply be successful at - I go back and say "Just try..."</p>
	<p>So hard - but try to suspend the judgement - things take time to sink in</p>
	<p>It's like the knowledge has to marinate in your brain, soaking up the stuff and then organize it into a simple plan.</p>
	<p>Sorry for the mixed metaphors....:)</p>
