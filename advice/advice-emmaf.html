			<h4>Don't get Overwhelmed</h4>
			<p>Learning something new can seem overwhelming at first, but remember
			that practice makes perfect. Take it slow, use all the cheatsheets and
		  resources that Skillcrush provides, do some research on your own, and repeat
	    steps as much as needed</p>

			<p>Don't forget to reach out to fellow Skillcrushers and schedule office
			hours.</p>

			<h4>Get up and Stretch.</h4>
			<p>It is very easy to lose track of time when you are coding. Make sure you
			set an alarm and stand up and stretch at least for five minutes every hour.</p>

			<p>Drinking lots of water helps too!</p>
