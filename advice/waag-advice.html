			<h4>Old Dogs CAN Learn New Tricks!</h4>
			<p>It's so easy to feel like you don't understand anything, you'll never know what you're doing, and start questioning why you even took on this challenge. Give. It. Time. How much time varies by person.</p>
			<p>As with any worthwhile endeavor, you'll get out of it what you put into it. Simmer in the discomfort. Step away when you can't find the mistake you know is making your code wonk. But don't ever stop persevering! When you find that stray piece of code then correct it, and magic happens, it's all worth it. You will feel like a genius BECAUSE YOU ARE!</p>
			<h4>Be a badass with a record.</h4>
			<p>No, I don't mean commit a crime or become an outlaw. Embrace all of that experience that makes you an "old dog". Your life experience is not wasted just because you are learning something new. Just the opposite. It feeds this new journey. It gives you insights others don't have. It informs the developer or designer you are becoming and will add value for the next chapter!</p>
