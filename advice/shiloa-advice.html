			<h4>Don't Give Up!!</h4>
			<p>There are going to be times when you suddenly feel like you don't understand anything.</p>
			<p>(This will most likely occur when you start trying to figure out JavaScript.)</p>
			<p>DON'T GIVE UP!!!  You're not too stupid to do this, it's not beyond you, it's just a completely different way of thinking that you're not used to yet.  Keep at it, keep trying to figure out how to solve the challenges, and when you can't, look at the solutions and make sure you understand why they work and yours didn't.</p>
			<p>If all else fails, know when and how to ask for help.  Mightybell is great, but GOOGLE IS YOUR LIFELONG BEST FRIEND.  If you can figure out how to ask the question, it %100 DEFINITELY has the answer.</p>
			<p>Eventually things will start to click, and you'll feel like a total rockstar again.</p>
