			<h4>Don't Beat Yourself Up Trying to be Perfect</h4>
			<p>I has been quite a battle for me to grasp that there is more than one way to code the same page and that it doesn't have to match the comp perfectly.  I have punished myself way too much chasing after a 'picture perfect' match to the design.  I'm understanding now, especially as a beginner, that getting close is considered a win.  The padding may not be the exact number of pixels and maybe the text isn't the exact weight, but if your layout matches the comp, all your images are showing up, links are working, and the page includes all the text in the comp, you can be proud of yourself!</p>

			<h4>Take Breaks and Ask For Help</h4>
			<p>Sometimes you've stared at some code for so long, especially in frustration, that there's just no way you're going to see what needs to be fixed without walking away for a little while.  I have also stared at code for hours, determined to solve the issue, but without success.  It wasn't until I walked away and came back with a different attitude and fresh eyes that the fix became obvious.</p><br/>

			<p>This is also where asking for help comes in.  I haven't done it nearly enough and I could have save a lot of time (and a few tears as well), if I had just asked for a little guidance.  The Skillcrush instructors are so patient and kind and never make you feel like you should know what to do.  Finding errors is also a learning process that takes time to learn as well.  Dont' forget to use the awesome tools available to check your code, such as W3C's html validator at <a href="validator.w3.org">validator.w3.org</a></p>
