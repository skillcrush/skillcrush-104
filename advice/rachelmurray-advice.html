			<h4>Don't slow down</h4>
			<p>If you get overwhelmed, it's easy to want to put everything down for a few weeks and come back. The lesson that took me way too long to learn is: even if you walk away for a while, you're going to be facing the same challenege when you come back.</p>

			<p>Sometimes stepping back for a few hours or a few days is good, but don't let it slow down your progress.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
