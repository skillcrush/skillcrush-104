			<h2>Yo no habló código! No problimente...</h2>
			<p>I do not speak code! No problem... Coding really is learning another language. You don't realise how fluent you've become until you get a chance to talk/write about it.
			We all know that if you're learning a new language, the more you practice and the more challenges you face, the better. There's going to be
			plenty and plenty of times that you think you've got no idea what you're actually doing, and that's perfectly okay!</p>
			<h2>Escribe un diario/blog</h2>
			<p>Write a diary/blog. Start writing about your experiences from the beginning. This could be a personal diary or even a blog. Writing about the hurdles you're
			encountering as well as the triumphs will help you to enjoy your coding journey. Once you've got a little more experience under your belt,
			you'll quite likely enjoy looking back on what you wrote.</p>
			<h2>No es perfecto</h2>
			<p>It's not perfect. Don't try and perfect your work (be it a personal portfolio, or something for a client), particularly when you're still in the very early stages
			of learning code. Chances are that there's a great solution up ahead, but you won't reach it till you're ready to 'ship' what you're currently working on
			(or at least take a break from it). I spent a long time trying to get my portfolio looking a certain way, little did I know that I would be learning
			exactly what I needed in order to do it in the next week. Rather than falling a week behind in my course, I could have moved on for the time being and
			saved myself a lot of hassle.</p>
			<h2>Los foros de código son tu amigo</h2>
			<p>Code forums are your friend. When you're having trouble designing an aspect of a website, keep in mind that there's probably someone, somewhere
			in the world who's also done the same! You can simply use the beautiful tools you have at our disposal (in this case, search engines). The worst that
			could possibly happen is that the code doesn't work the way you thought it would (in which case you've still learnt something), or it doesn't work at all (so you look at another forum)</p>
