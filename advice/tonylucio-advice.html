			<h4>OY-VAY, Coffee, Grey hair, and a Boss mentality</h4>
			<p>Look.  I'm not going to beat around the bush.  Technology is difficult to understand.  HOWEVER, you WILL succeed.</p>

			<p>It is super easy to just put off learning something new. It will be easy to let your mind wander. Don't let that come in front of you and a great future.</p>

			<p>You will learn something exciting, something new, something you can walk away from and come back and knock technology out of the park. You will climb mountains. You will come to a dragon and that beast will draw a line in front of you with a great fiery blaze...but you will cross that line more than once.</p>

			<h4>Deep breath.  And now the plunge.  You Boss.</h4>
			<p>Yes it is simple.  You either will or will not do it.  The choice is yours.  Take the blue pill or red pill (Matrix reference).  You are Neo.  You will see how far the rabbit hole goes.  You are a boss and will prevail.</p>

			<p>Self-doubt.  Can't.  Won't.  Impossible.  These words are meaningless.  Focus on the words Can, Do, Yes, Win, and Winning</p>

			<p>Coffee and being a boss did it for me.  What will do it for you?</p>
