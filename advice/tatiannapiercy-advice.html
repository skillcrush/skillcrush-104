			<h4>Google is your best friend!</h4>
			<p>Coding for me in the beginnin was terrifying. I didn't think I was smart enough or young enough to retain the information that would be given to me. Lol, that actually held true until repition kicked in and what I didn't remember, I googled &amp; found what I quite couldn't get my finger on.</p>

			<p>Confusion is a sign that you are heading in the right direction I have been told and now believe. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits. And when they say "keep going", that means, stop for five minutes, grab a cup of tea/coffee, count to 10 saying some beautiful affirmations and attack it again.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening. I have my periods when I just want to pull my hair out and scream, but it alsos lights a fire under me to try and figure things out.</p>

			<p>I am a true believer that this is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process, so just trust it.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
