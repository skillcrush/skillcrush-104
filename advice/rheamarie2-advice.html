			<h4>Practice makes progress.</h4>
			<p>I always put aside time to keep on top of my lessons, but I wish I had more time to keep practicing everything I've learned. I believe the more I use these newly learned skills, the better I'll understand everything and the easier workflow will go.</p>
			<h4>Don't be afraid to put yourself out there!</h4>
			<p>Don't wait until you feel comfortable or perfect at everything. Have enough courage to put your new skills out there into the world. You may be surprised by the support and encouragement that you receive.</p>
