			<h4><span>Confusion</span> is your friend!</h4>
			<p>Confusion is your brain trying to wrap itself around something it doesn't understand. Something it's never encountered before, or is encountering in a new and different way.</p>

			<p class="cynthiagibson-advice-pbs">Confusion means you're challenging yourself. Confusion is a double-dog-dare-you. Confusion means you're alive and learning and kicking and clawing. </p>
			
			<h4>You are confused. Therefore you<span class="cynthiagibson-advice-span"> ARE</span></h4>
			<p>When you are nose-to-nose with a new technology, whether you're learning to write your first programming language or just trying to become besties with the latest-greatest framework, there's always an uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p class="cynthiagibson-advice-pbs">This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology. In fact, it's a critical part of the process of learning a new technology.</p>

			<p>You see, when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes training your eye, and the best way to do that is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
			
			<p>And gradually, through repetition, it all starts to make sense.</p>
			
			<p class="cynthiagibson-advice-pbs">Remember when you learned to read, and one day it went from letters to words to sentences?</p>
			
			<p><span>No?</span></p>
			
			<h4>Neither do I!</h4>
			
			<p class="cynthiagibson-advice-pbs">But we both know it happened.</p>
			
			<p>So: Trust the process. And trust yourself.</p>
			
			<p>And learn to love <span class="cynthiagibson-advice-span">Confusion</span></p>
