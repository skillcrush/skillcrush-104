			<h4>Use your frustration to your advantage!</h4>
			<p>When I started to learn coding, I thought I would pick everything up easy, and be like "Neo" of the coding world. What I found is that it isn't always easy. There are times that I get frustrated and can't figure something out, and want to quit. </p>

			<p>I have found that the best feeling in the world is when I have been beating my head against the wall trying to figure something out, and then it clicks. See, frustration is a good thing, because it means that you will not quit in the site of adversity. Frustration can keep your mind on a problem trying to solve it, even if you walk away for fresh eyes. You have to keep on pushing for your goal, and never give up.</p>

			<h4>Never stop being a student.</h4>
			<p>When you are pursuing the life of a coder, you need to expect to learn ALOT. Don't just think that you will learn all you need to know and then be set for the rest of your life, because it doesn't work that way.</p>

			<p>Learning to code is a process, and once you have learned the basics, you are not done. You should always be striving to keep learning and improving. Technology is a fast moving field, and if you do not keep pushing forward, it will leave you behind.</p>

			<p>Always pursue learning oppurtunities, and be willing to listen to those around you to become better. You want to be the best you that you can possibly be!</p>
