			<h4>Just keep swimming!</h4>

			<p> No matter how lost, confused, or stressed you get just keep going. JavaScript was probably the hardest thing for me to understand and it is still a concept out there. It will be fine and get better.
			<h4>Get the word out there!</h4>
			<p>The more people you know the more help and advice you get. Even if this is a scary thing for you.</p>

			<h4>Fake it until you make it!</h4>

			<p>If you fake it you will eventually understand what you are doing and eventually will become more knowledge than you could guess.</p>
