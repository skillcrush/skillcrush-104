			<h4><strong>Girls <u>can</u> code too!</strong></h4>
			<p>&hearts; I <strong>know</strong> this may seem silly to say, but I'm going to say it anyways; <strong>girls can code too</strong>! Never in a million years did I ever think I'd be interested in programming. I never even thought I was smart enough or that I would enjoy it AT ALL. But boy was I wrong! I used to think that programmers were smelly dudes coding in their basements all hours of the night, with absolutely no social skills at all. Kind of harsh but I'm just being honest! Women may be outnumbered in the industry, but don't let that deter you from learning (assuming you are a female) because we can be programmers too! <strong>You ARE smart enough</strong>! &hearts;</p>

			<h4>Google is <strong><u>the</u></strong> shit.</h4>
			<p>&hearts; Seriously, part of being a good problem solver is being efficient at finding the answers, even if that means using Google as support! There are <strong>TONS</strong> of <strong>free</strong> resources available to you; <strong>USE IT</strong>! You don't have to know everything! And <strong><u>no</u></strong>, it is <strong>NOT</strong> considered cheating! &hearts;</p>
