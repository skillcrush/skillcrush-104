			<h4>Google and research are your friends!!!!!!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming, use as many resources to learn the material as you possibly can. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and can be quite confusing. Each resource teaches and explains the material in different ways. The more resources from which you have to draw, the better you will learn the material.</p>

			<p>I began trying to learn HTML and CSS on one online course. I then went immediately to another class. This was my biggest mistake in this learning process, as the material had not sunk in completely. This made it difficult to take the next steps. I became frustrated as I could tell other students understood and were passing me by. I tried to keep up by cutting and pasting, but I never really understood what I was doing.</p>

			<h4>If at first you don't succeed, try again.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, it can be rather daunting - especially if others around you already have a bit of background in the language or just happen to be picking it up faster. Don't rush. We all learn different things at different rates. Stop. Take a deep breath. Look around. Find another resource that explains things differently. Pick up a book at the bookstore. Try courses on Lynda.com. Eventually, it should all become clear enough to get confident and you can move on to the next language.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
