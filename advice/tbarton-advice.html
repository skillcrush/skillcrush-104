			<h4>Stay Positive</h4>
			<p>When you first start to code you are going to make mistakes however it feels good when you figure out what those mistakes were and you know how to fix them. :) </p>

			<p>Use the Skillcrush community and Slack.  I have found them to be very useful.</p>

			<h4>Believe in yourself.</h4>

			<p>Have the mindset of a champion.  If you believe it you can achieve it.</p>
