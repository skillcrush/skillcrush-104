				<h4>Practice, Practice, Practice</h4>
				<p>Reading books, articles and watching tutorials are great ways to learn more about a certain tech skill. However, if there's one thing I think everyone should spend more time doing its practicing. Getting in there and creating a project to show what you're learning not only helps all the information stick, but it also gives you experience. As an added bonus you'll even have some nice projects to show off. Lately I've been applying this in my own learning and it's showing great results. It makes me feel better about what I'm learning because I can actually complete small projects and feel a sense of accomplishment. It feels even better knowing I'm building my portfolio and improving my skills.</p>

				<h4>Don't Compare Yourself to Others</h4>
				<p>I think too many people compare themselves to others. This can have a negative affect on you. It can make you feel like you're not good enough or like you don't belong. So instead of falling into the trap of comparing yourself to others, I think you should compare yourself to yourself. Continue to focus on practicing your skills and only compare yourself to the former you and look at how far you've come. Look at everything you've learned and look at how close you are to achieving what it is that you actually want.</p>
