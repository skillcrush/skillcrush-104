			<h4>Practice! Practice! Practice!</h4>
			<p>By practicing a little bit every day, you keep what you've learned fresh in your mind. I made the mistake of taking a bit too long a break and when I finally got back to work I felt lost. Lesson learned. </p>

			<h4>Have Fun!</h4>
			<p>Coding can sometimes feel monotonous, so it's important to make it fun. Put together a special playlist, or have your favourite TV show on in the background, as long as it isn't too distracting. I like to always have a nice cup of coffee when I code.</p>

			<h4>Breathe!</h4>
			<p>It can be very frustrating when you get stuck on a lesson or something isn't working in your code. Take a deep breathe, take a break, go for a walk, play with your dog, and remind yourself how far you've come.</p>

			<h4>Ask for Help!</h4>
			<p>If you're having trouble with something, chances are someone else is too. Don't be afraid to ask for help, and look stuff up online. There are tons of resources out there and I've found answers to my questions with just a few minutes on google.</p>
