			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start learning your first non-native language you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is ... listening, reading, speaking, writing and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or speak a new language, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process. You are becoming familiarised !. </p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eyes and ears. The way to train them is to read a good deal of words and to listen to spoken pronounciation, even when you don't totally understand it.</p>
