			<h4>Never give up; never surrender!</h4>
			<p>You may not be able to solve every problem right away. But you can always apply your problem-solving techniques.</p>

			<p>That includes asking for help if you get stuck! Unlike other courses, you&rsquo;re not on your own with Skillcrush. You have professional developers who are there to guide you every step of the way.</p>

			<h4>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to fail</h4>
			<p>Screwing up is inevitable. You&rsquo;ll make a typo. You&rsquo;ll forget some essential bit of syntax (like putting single quotes around your @font-face font).</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s not a big deal. You won&rsquo;t break the internet. Just keep working the problem as above, and ask for help if you need it.</p>
