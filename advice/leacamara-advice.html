			<h4>Be Brave!</h4>
			<p>Deciding to take a leap and learn something new - especially when you're hoping to be able to make a new career out of it - is scary!!! So - be brave. Be very brave. </p>

			<h4>Build yourself up. Repeat positive mantras.</h4>
			<p>Tell yourself you're capable. Tell yourself you can do it. Tell yourself you WILL make this happen. If they can do it, so can you!</p>

			<h4>Keep reminding yourself: You've come so far!</h4>
			<p>I know I've learned A LOT in a short amount of time. But - when there's always so much more to learn - it can feel like you're getting nowhere! That you'll NEVER be "qualified"! But - like so many other things in life (think: wealth, status, looks), we'll always be somewhere <em>in the middle.</em> Not the best. But definitely not the worst.</p>

			<h4>Be OK with the fact that you'll always make mistakes.</h4>
			<p>But always be humble enough to want to learn what they are and how to fix them.</p>

			<h4>Definitely keep learning.</h4>
			<p>Just don't stop.</p>

			<h4>Frame it like an adventure.</h4>
			<p>You're on an adventure to keep exploring and finding out the type of work you <em>really</em> enjoy.</p>
