			<h4>Don’t Be Afraid to Ask for Help or to Help People Back</h4>
			<p>Programming is actually a really social activity. I would not be as good of a programmer as I am now if I didn’t have their help—each of my friends are good at certain areas so whenever I have a problem, I know which friend to ask. I also help them out in return when they have a problem. This is really the only way to get things done.</p>
			<h4>Learn How to Google</h4>
			<p>A lot of beginners under-appreciate the degree which googling things is a part of a programmer’s job. Sometimes my job is more about knowing how to search for something than it is actually programming.</p>
			<h4>Have fun</h4>
			<p>Want to be stuck on the career treadmill? Hate your job. What it takes to move up in this business is not merely dogged determination to bring home an ever growing paycheck but an actual enjoyment of your work. If you do not like your work and you are a junior developer, what makes you think that being an intermediate or senior developer will be any better? Change jobs or change careers. On the other hand, if you love the work you are doing, great! I guarantee that you can become a better developer if you keep at it.</p>
