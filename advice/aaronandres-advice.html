			<h1>Embrace the struggle!</h1>
			<p>When you start programming use the resources around you to try to figure out as much as possible on your own.  Once you truly get stuck then reach out for help. You will learn much more this way and you develop good habits as a problem solver.</p>

			<p>Don't wait too long to ask for help because sometimes you just need a nudge to get you going in the right direction.  Think of everything you do as a learning opportunity.  Each step is a challenge and each time you are able to complete one of those challenges you have overcome. The more times you are able to do this the more resilient you will become and the more confidence you will gain.</p>

			<p>Finally, make sure you are balanced.  Be intense with your learing, but also learn to take breaks and clear your mind.  find something that works for you.  I suggest a brisk walk, some calestenics, or maybe a quick yoga session. Once you have cleared your mind, come back to the problem and you will have a much better chance of finding a solution and you will just feel better over all.</p>
