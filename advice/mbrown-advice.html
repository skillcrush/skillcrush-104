			<h4>Don't feel like you have to know everything at once!</h4>
			<p>When I learn something new, I often struggle during the early stages because I do not feel like I know enough, which is silly because I am learning! When I learn new things, there is a phase where I start to really understand how much I don't know. This can be very overwhelming at first. Pushing through this is difficult but important.</p>


			<h4>Don't get overwhelmed!</h4>
			<p>Easier said than done, but I fight this feeling in a few ways:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><span>Take small steps.</span> I focus on what I am working on right now.</li>
				<li><span>Track and celebrate progress.</span> I try to track the progress I have made by marking milestones, and I also take time to appreciate how far I have come!</li>
				<li><span>Admire others' work, but don't compare.</span> They have probably been doing it longer than I have, and if not, so what? Everyone comes with different experiences and skillsets that he/she can offer.</li>
			</ul>
