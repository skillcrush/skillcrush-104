			<h4>If you are even thinking of making a career change... just do it!!</h4>

			<p>Dont wait. I thought about it and thought about it and all you are doing is wasting time. There must be a reason you are even googling options and landing upon the Skillcrush page. I also pondered for a while and ended up joing up anyway so just take the leap! Its always best to be ahead of change so just take the first step and you will not regret it.</p>

			<h4>When you are confused and feel lost...</h4>
			<p>When I started to get lost, oh and you will, it's easy to want to stop and take a break. However, it's best to try to get to the root of why it is not clicking for you. The best advice I can give when you are confused is to stay with it, use any means necessary to figure it out whether you use youtube tuturials, ask other class mates, or set up office hours. You will get it and you will have a sense of pride once you figure it out!</p>

			<h4>Anything that takes work, is worth doing!</h4>
			<p>Hang in there! I know everything seems like another language, well it is lol, make sure to hang in there as it will all click eventually. Anything that is worth while takes hard work. You have to put in the time and then you will gain the benefits and see the results!</p>

		<div class="jenfidd-col">
			<h4>You have to give 10,000 hours to become an expert at something!</h4>

			<p>I heard Oprah say this in one of her interviews and maybe it is someone else's quote but to get better at something or become an expert you have to devote time and energy. You do not just wake up and have these skills. Yes it may come easier to others but to become like it's second nature you have to work at it everyday so you stay fresh!</p>
