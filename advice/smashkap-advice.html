				<h4>Never hesitate to ask for help!</h4>
				<p>When you make the decision to learn to code, you are going to have a LOT of questions--always ask them!</p>

				<p>There are so many great resources available out there on the interwebs, including right here at Skillcrush.  Most likely, someone has already had the exact same question you currently have.  There are no stupid questions, especially when you are learning an entirely new skillset!</p>

				<h4>Invest in yourself and your future!</h4>
				<p>There are a lot of great online coding resourses that are free...  but the investment in a paid program (like Skillcrush) is well worth the investment.</p>

				<p>Think about where you want to be in five years, take a leap of faith, and just go for it.</p>
