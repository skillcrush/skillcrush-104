			<h4>Take a break when a tough problem seems unsolveable!</h4>
			<p>It's easy to get overloaded when you're learning a new skill, taxonimy, rules, etc.  You will make mistakes - some big and some miniscule.  When this happnes and you begin to feel weighed down by a problem, get up and move around.  Do something different so your brain can take a break and refresh.  You will be surprised how solutions pop up when you go back to debugging!</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
