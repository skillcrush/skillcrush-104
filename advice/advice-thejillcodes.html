				<h4>There is an answer for <u>every</u> question.</h4>
				<p>It is easy to feel overwhelmed by unfamiliar jargon and inundated with solutions from online searches.</p>

				<p>As a beginner in a tech field, you are lucky to have online resources and message board updated in real time. Find sites like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> or <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/">WC3</a> and add not only the info to your working document, but a referral link to review future updates.</p>

				<p>Once you find the learning style that suits you and you create a knowledge base, then it will be easy for you to not only become fluent but learn new programming languages.</p>

				<h4>Organize your processes along the way.</h4>
				<p>You are going to have to <em>learn how to learn</em>, and constantly check in with yourself.</p>

				<p>Do not be scared to document successful processes in a language that you understand. In fact, these notes are crucial for continued development and problem solving. No one should have to search through open tabs and PDFs -- if you have to look something up, then you'd better include the solution in your working document! </p>
