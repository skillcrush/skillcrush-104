			<h4>Starting Out</h4>
			<p><span>&quot;Confusion is evidence of neither failure nor stupidity, but of cognition kicking into gear. Treat confusion like the soreness of your muscles after a long workout&semi; learn to relish it as a signal of proper form.&quot;</span></p>

			<h4>When in Doubt - Ask!</h4>
			<p>Part of the learning process involves a journey through self discovery. This path, like many, has twists and turns.  If you find yourself broken down on the side of the road, don't wait too long before calling for help!  Practice articulating your roadblock and asking for help is all part of the journey to learning something new.</p>
