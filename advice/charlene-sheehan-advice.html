			<h4>So many costs!</h4>
			<p> At first, this program seems expensive, but $200 a month is doable, right?!</p>
			<p> Well, there's not only that. Don't forget the Adobe costs, and the website costs, and who know what else is left...</p>
			<p>Don't screw yourself financially for this! Cut back on your personal expenses (bars, new clothes and uber - I'm looking at you). Work extra shifts if possible!</p>
			<p>Keep paying for the program, but hold off on the recurring extra fees as long as you can if you can't afford it! </p>
			<h4>But most importantly...</h4>
			<h1>don't give up!</h1>
			<p>You've already made it this far! It's frustrating at times, but we're going to make it. Keep working hard and your future in development is all yours!</p>
