			<h4>Get frustrated, but don't let it consume you!</h4>
			<p>My frustration made working on my projects very challenging.  I didn't realize my confusion would end if I gave it time.  Some projects were put off until the very end, because I resented the work. Had I left that resentment hold me back from pushing forward, I would never have met Ruby, or realized my potential.</p>

			<h4>Sign up, get involved, connect, connect, connect</h4>
			<p>Find every news letter and group you can about the coding you love and sign up.  Right now.  You won't understand what these groups are talking about at the beginning, but having the exposure to their discussion will familiarize you with terms and common know-how.</p>

			<p>I started a twitter account sort of late in the game.  I still don't update it enough.  Maybe I'm afraid my new tech connections will laugh at me? I don't know.  I DO KNOW that everyone has been newb status before.  Don't be shy!</p>
