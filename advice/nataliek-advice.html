			<h4>Take a step back</h4>
			<p>If you ever feel stuck (after exhausting all your resources of course), take a step back, take a short break, take a beat and return to it later. Minor mistakes or minor misunderstandings can be difficult to see when you've thought you've done everything right the first time around. Fresh eyes work best at catching old mistakes.</p>

			<h4>Stick to a schedule and hold yourself accountable</h4>
			<p>If you stick to a schedule and hold yourself accountable it will help in times where you feel like you want to stop when you're not "getting it". Keep with the lesson plan! Take small steps in understanding each piece that might be confusing you. Remember, there are other resources out there to find information about this work if you're stuck. If you find yourself losing momentum, look for other avenues to keep you motivated and inspired to keep going, because if you stop it will be that much harder to start back up again.</p>

			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
