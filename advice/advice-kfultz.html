			<h2>You don't have to be good at math</h4>
			<p>When I was 13, I was super in to making choose-your-own-adventure pages with HTML. I went to computer camp, took apart my CPU at home, and bought books with titles like 'Learn C++ in 21 Days'. I was sure I wanted to be a computer programmer.</p>

			<p>When I got to high school, the adults in my life all told me that I should focus on my math classes, because to be a programmer I needed to do well in math.</p>

			<h2>But my math classes sucked.</h4>
			<p>I didn't do as well in my math classes as I did in other classes-- I didn't do poorly, but I didn't excel. I became convinced that this meant I wasn't cut out for programming. I turned to foreign language instead, and gave up on programming almost entirely.</p>

			<p>The thing is, you don't need to be a math whiz in order to learn computer programming. There are certain elements of logic that the two fields share, but that logic is not exclusive to math. The same type of critical thinking skills and creative problem solving processes are also used in learning learning a foreign language, working in design, and doing original research.</p>

			<p>Programming (as well as high-level math, or the aforementioned fields) is not about learning some prescriptive logic. The most important skill for a programmer to have is the ability to maintain an attitude of curiosity-- to be willing to explore multiple solutions to a problem and to play around with them until you find the right one. This skill is common to a variety of fields, not just math.</p>
