			<h2>Keep plugging away</h2>
			<p>The best advice I have is to keep plugging away. There will be times you will feel so lost. Go back to the last point in lesson you understood and work through the assignment step by step.</p>
			<p>You'll find answers you never thought to look for.</p>
			<h2>Google is your friend!</h2>
			<p>Ask Google just about any question. You'll find out two things. First, the answer to your question. And second, that you are not alone in your confusion because someone else before you had to ask the same question.</p>
			<h2>Have friends who code</h2>
			<p>Whether they are irl friends or online friends because they'll get why you've become so obsessed with this new thing you are learning.<br>And if your friend is say a senior programmer with close to three decades of experience,<br>you'll find out that looking up how to write something and learning on the fly are part of the job description.</p>
			<p>No matter what, you aren't going through anything that someone else hasn't already experienced.</p>
