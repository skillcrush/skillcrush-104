			<h4>Lots of things are your friends!</h4>
			<p>Split screen windows are you friends. Without split-screen, I probably would have lost my mind a month into my coding venture.<p>

			<p>Also, google is your friend. Many git errors can be googled and solutions are found without you stressing about "what does this even mean, I have no idea how to do this."</p>

			<p>Code as much and as often as you can. If you get stuck, don't be afraid to put it down and walk away for a moment, but <strong>always</strong> come back to it.<p>

				<p>Music can be a great help. Coding to your favorite tunes can make things go by much smoother, whether it's some Bach or some Zedd, whatever the case may be. Personally, I'm been jamming to Billy Joel on Pandora. A variety of oldies that gets my foot tapping and my fingers coding.</p>

				<p>colourlovers (see badge below) is so handy for complimentary color choices! Like a picture's colors? They have something called PHOTOCOPA that will allow you to pluck colors from images. They also have patterns you can use and color, or make yourself, and a whole host of other tools. Just make sure to check their terms for commercial use!</p>
