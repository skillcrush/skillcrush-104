			<h4>Get a job in Tech!</h4>
			<p>Trust me when I say: you can only love your job so much.</p>
			<p>Be smart, get a job that pays well so that you can pursue whatever passions you want.</p>

			<h4>Don't forget to speak up.</h4>
			<p>Speak your truth. For women in tech, this can sometimes be hard. It's a male-dominated field. But you'll never get what you want if you stay silent.</p>
