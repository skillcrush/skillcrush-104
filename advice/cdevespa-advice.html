			<h4>Left Brain is your friend!</h4>
			<p>Before I started coding I spent 20 plus years as a painter and art prof. I often used mostly the right side of my brain for creativity. The logical left half was excersized much less. Working with code really helps me use and strengthen that part of my brain and it is getting sharper! I love when my brain feels tired from too much time at the code gym!</p>

			<p>The right hemisphere is also mu friend when coding because it helps me be intuitive towards problem solving and design. While this may not be the most efficient approach to problem solving it is the funnest.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
