			<h4>Chaos is useful!?</h4>
			<p>Honestly, I find it difficult for myself to give advice to anyone about coding, because I'm still learning myself.</p>

			<p>I do believe, however, that many established computer programmers would retort coding is a continuous learning process.</p>
			<h4>Don't let making mistakes dissuade you from pursuing your goal of establishing coding knowledge.</h4>
			<p>When you're learning something new, especially a new technology that is ever improving and changing, I would say to pace yourself.</p>

			<p>Do not rush and work meticulously. It is easy to move fast, and make silly errors which will ruin your entire code. These mistakes like to hide from you against the black backdrop of your coding abyss.</p>

			<p>Work smart and hard, and never let failure get you down. Keep on trying, you'll figure it out!</p>
