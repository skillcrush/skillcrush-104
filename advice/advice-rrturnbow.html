			<h4>Stick With It!</h4>
			<p>When I started this journey, I had a little family and a part time job so finding the time to learn coding was rough. I even had to put it away and restart. For a while I thought this wasn't for me, but I knew it was something I had been wanting to do for a long time. So I just stuck with it.</p>

			<p>Sometimes I lack the motivation to open up my computer and get to work. So I take it in small pieces one day at a time. But, each time I learn a little more, I feel a little more accomplished.</p>

			<h4>Take Notes</h4>
			<p>Skillcrush provides a lot of great printable resources that are perfect for helping you refresh what you already learned. So whether you print them and keep them in a notebook or save them all to your computer - KEEP THEM!</p>

			<p>On top of keeping the resources provided by Skillcrush, take notes on the things you want to remember. You'll need them later.</p>

			<p>It's also a good idea to bookmark all the webpages suggested by Skillcrush so you can easily find them when you need to reference things like hex color finders and css ideas.</p>
