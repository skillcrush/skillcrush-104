			<h2>Learn at Your Own Pace</h2>
			<p>I've learned that it takes me a little longer than some people to get new ideas and concepts to stick. It can be
				daunting when you're in a class with others who seem to get it quicker and move on faster than you do. Just remember you learn
				at you're own speed and never mind everyone else!</p>
			<h2> Manage your time</h2>
			<p>	Everyone has the same 24-hours in a day. Whether you spend that on Facebook, watching Netflix, or learning to code so you
				can advance your career - it's all up to you.</p>
