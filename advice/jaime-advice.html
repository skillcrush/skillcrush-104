			<h4>It's Overwhelming!</h4>
			<p>When you start learning to code, it will be overwhelming, for sure.  You are learning a new skill and a whole new language.  Some of it may be intuitive and some of it may seem like nonsense, but keep at it, and it will feel so rewarding.</p>



			<h4>It's the Little Things!</h4>
			<p>I have learned that it's the little things that really make you feel accomplished and show your progress.  Those little mistakes that you can't find, like your HTML and CSS not linking up, are mistakes that you will learn from and always remember.</p>

			<p>Mistakes are such an important part of the process, as they teach you the skills of troubleshooting, and learning to become skilledd at Googling and reaching out to your resources.</p>
