			<h4>Work Methodically</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Working methodically will help keep you from getting confused and will allow you to build upon your newly learned skills, line upon line and precept upon precept.   If you try to jump ahead into something that you don't understand too soon, you might find yourself frustrated and stuck.  Unless you have a good mentor who can step in and offer advice on where you went wrong, you may have to scrap your entire project and start over. </p>

			<h4>Test Code Often</h4>
			<p>Checking your work often is an important part of methodical programming.  This means building your application one piece at a time.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>First you might write a line of code to print. (test it)</li>
				<li>Then you might add some i/o. (test it)</li>
				<li>Then you might try adding some variables, (test it again).</li>
				<li>Add a method (test)</li>
				... you get the idea...
			</ul>  
			<p>As you add each new piece of complexity to your program you need to continue to test to make sure that the entire program still works.  </p>

			<p>By programming methodically, when your code ceases to work (and it WILL cease to work at some point), you can simply comment out the most recent change and test the code again.   If it works, then you know that the most recent line of code is the culprit.
			</p> 

			<p>On the other hand, if you make too many changes at once you can find yourself in the predicament on not knowing exactly which piece of code broke your program.  </p>

			<h4>Don't Re-Invent the Wheel</h4>
			<p>While writing your own original code can be fun and exciting, sometimes the method you need has already been written.  It's often quicker and easier to look online and find some good, working sample code, play with it and customize it, but when it's obvious your borrowing code, don't forget to acknowledge your source.  </p>
			<p>Thanks Peter Wolf for your lovely style-sheet!  It was a great jumping off point!</p>
