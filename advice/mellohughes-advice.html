			<h4>Take it step-by-step</h4>
			<p>Learning anything is easy if you break it down into bite-sized chunks! Take it step-by-step, day-by-day, and focus on celebrating the progress you've made during each session, however small it seems.</p>

			<p>Remember to dip in and do something every single day - turning learning into a habit means less conscious effort will be required to motivate yourself each day! Even if it's just half and hour's work - don't skip it.</p>

			<h4>Keep an open mind and a determined attitude</h4>
			<p>Don't close your mind and make things harder for yourself by holding onto limiting beliefs. Convince yourself that you can learn to code, that it's easy if you take it one day at a time, and be determined to succeed.</p>

			<p>If you get stuck, take a break and give your mind chance to figure out the answer. There's always a solution to every problem and your mind will find it!</p>
