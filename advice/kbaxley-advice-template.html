			<h4>Mistakes Happen</h4>
			<p>Part of learning how to write code is making mistakes. Learn from them. </p>

			<p>Use your mistakes as a chance to learn. I find it helpful to research for the answer before reaching out to the group. I feel like I learn better that way.</p>

			<h4>Take a Break</h4>
			<p>When you get discouraged to a break.</p>

			<p>Walk away from your work.</p>

			<p>When you return, you may see something you were missing before.</p>
