			<h4>Get comfortable not feeling comfortable</h4>
			<p>Learning a new skill, and in fact growing in any way, is not a comfortable process. There is going to be frustration. There is going to be self doubt. But be patient and give yourself the opportunity to stretch and change and learn.</p>

			<h4>Celebrate the small victories and get a cheerleader</h4>
			<p>It might seem silly, but don't be afraid to celebrate the small victories. Be proud of what you are learning and take the time to be excited, to reward yourself, or to brag. You're doing amazing new things and you should be proud of that!</p>

			<p>It's also helpful to recruit yourself a cheerleader from your friends and family. Having the extra encouragement when things get hard and the support and excitement when you are doing well is hugely beneficial.</p>

			<h4>Google is your friend</h4>
			<p>If you're having difficulty figuring something out, it is always worthwhile to do a quick Google. If you are being challenged by it, odds are others have as well and I have found ways to fix problems with a simple Google search.</p>
