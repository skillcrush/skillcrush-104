			<h4>It isn't too hard to learn!</h4>
			<p>You might think you aren't a code person but anyone can learn. Don't limit what tech skills you can learn based upon the story you tell yourself.</p>

			<h4>Imposter syndrome happens to everyone.</h4>

			<p>Everyone else is learning as they go too. Don't wait for things to be perfect before you share and ask questions.</p>
