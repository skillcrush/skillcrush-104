			<h4>Absence makes the heart grown fonder</h4>
			<p>If you're like me and don't have a lot of confidence in yourself it's
				easy to dislike your work, especially if you've been spending a lot of
				time on it. If it's starting to get to you take some time away from your
				project and let it simmer. You'll probably feel better about it when you
				come back to it later.</p>
			<h4>Move forward one step at a time</h4>
			<p>A good motivator is having something you want to do or make with code.
				Even if it's out of reach now, it still gives you purpose.</p>
			<p>Another thing is to keep going little by little. Even if it feels like
				you're not making progress it adds up eventually. If you put it off it's
				easy to stop working altogether.</p>
			<h4>Practice makes proficient</h4>
			<p>Even if it's a bit of a dead horse it's worth repeating. The more you
				try something out the easier it will get. And if you're still struggling
				with a concept look up different tutorials online, sometimes it just takes
				someone describing it in the right way for it to click.</p>
