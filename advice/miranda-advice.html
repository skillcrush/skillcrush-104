			<h4><span>1.</span>Patience is Critical</h4>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Particular when you’re learning something new it is so easy to get impatient. Learning can be hard and it often takes a lot of time. However, that’s not a bad thing.</p>

				<p>I believe that a lot of this impatience comes from a persistent  myth that says if you don’t learn something fast than you’re not good at it. I think that myth is holding so many of us back from accomplishing what we dream of.</p>

				<p>So don’t worry about proving that you’re good enough but putting pressure on yourself to learn super fast. Patiently put in the time and you can learn just about anything.</p>
			</div>

			<h4><span>2.</span>Take a Look Back</h4>
			<div class="content">
				<p>Every time I feel discouraged about how slowly I feel like I am moving through my life or how behind I think I am I take a look back.</p>

				<p>I think about where I was 6 months ago, a year ago or even five years ago and I am always amazing by how much I have accomplished.</p>

				<p>After realizing how far I have come I always feel much more confident that 6 months from now I will have made great progress, even if I feel very stuck right now.</p>
