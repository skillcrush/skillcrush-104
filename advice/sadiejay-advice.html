				<h4>Don't Be Afraid to Ask for and Seek Help!</h4>
				<p>All programmers google things from time to time. It's perfectly normal and probably more effecient than trying to guess for hours.</p>

				<p> <q>When in doubt, google.</q></p>

				<h4>Engage in Community</h4>
				<p>When learning something new, old, and in between, having a community to learn with is key. It takes the pressure off of having to feel like you can only turn to yourself when stressed, confused, or even celebratory.</p>

				<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

				<p> <q>You are not alone! You can do this!</q></p>
