			<h4>Don't listen to your fear!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>It's scary, and that can make you want to run the other direction. But facing your fears, and acknowledging and accepting that you don't have the answers, is a huge step in becoming a successful programmer. Nobody knows everything, and even seasoned programmers who've been working in this field for decades are still learning new tricks.</p>

			<h4>Keep trying.</h4>
			<p>We tend to glorify the easy answers, the blinding epiphanies, the grand gestures. True change (usually) doesn't work that way.</p>

			<p>Instead, we try, and we try again. Sometimes, it'll take you months to understand what seems like a basic concept. Sometimes, you'll spend ages believing that you really don't understand something at all - &amp; then someone will ask you a question about it, and the answer will roll off your tongue.</p>

			<p>Trust in yourself, &amp; don't give up.</p>
