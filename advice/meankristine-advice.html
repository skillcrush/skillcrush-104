			<h4>Don't try to learn everything!</h4>
			<p>When you first start programming you will not know where to start.  There are so many languages to choose from and so many resources for each of them.  And to top it all off new technologies are coming out everyday and everybody seems to have an opinion about where you should start.  It can be completely overwhelming.</p>

			<p>You will have the urge to try and learn all of the things, but stop!  Take a breath and pick just one language, it really doesn't matter which one.  Just pick one and dive in!  Otherwise you will find yourself constantly on the verge of starting to learn.  But once you just start you will build momentum quickly.  Just go for it!</p>

			<h4>Embrace ambiguation.</h4>
			<p>To go along with not learning everything, know that you will not understand everything you encounter.  Don't let that stop you!</p>

			<p>There are many ways to power through a road block. Find which way works for you and keep it in your back pocket, you will use it often.  Sometimes it is best just to move on and come back to the thing that you are stuck on later, often you will find that that thing that had stopped you in your tracks before makes perfect sense now.</p>

			<p>Oh, and don't worry that you won't run into the same problem again and never learn that thing; you most definitely will!</p>
