			<h4>Be proud of what you're doing</h4>
			<p>Every day, get up and take a look in the mirror. You are doing this. You can do this. Recognize how awesome you are for doing this and sticking with it. Be proud, because you deserve it.</p>

			<p>And while you're add it... you look beautiful, you are smart and you go rock that world of yours!</p>

			<h4>Surround yourself with a squad</h4>
			<p>All new things are hard. So make sure you are surrounded by people who encourage you. If need be, get your own cheerleading squad. They don't need to know anything about coding or technology. They just need to know you. So they can say just the right words to get you to the next stage.</p>

			<p>And the most important thing: Celebrate!! Even the smallest victory. Just do it. Life's too short not to celebrate.</p>

			<p>And now, onward!</p>
