			<h4>Your Age is Irrelevant</h4>
			<p>Don't ever let anyone tell you that you are too young or too old to begin a new journey.</p>

			<p>That is what education is, a new journey. <span>You can change your life</span> at any age.</p>

			<h4>Never give up.</h4>
			<p>Learn to embrace the things that stump you. When you get through them and figure them out you will have learned valuable lessons and feel elated.</p>

			<h4>Push yourself</h4>

			<p>Always push yourself further than you think you can go. Try new things. You cannot know if a programming language is going to thrill you until you dig in and go for it.</p>
