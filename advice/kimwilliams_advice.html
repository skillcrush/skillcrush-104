			<h4>Take it easy on yourself!</h4>
			<p>I didn't realize how slow the proccess of learning would be!</p>

			<p>My main advice would be to be patient with yourself</p>

			<h4>Don't forget to ask for help!</h4>
			<p>I get so frustrated with how slow my progress is and tend to forget to use the most important resource out there: other people!!</p>

			<p>Most people like to help others and it helps them reaffirm their knowledge by teaching you so don't feel bad about asking for help.</p>

			<p>Programming can be frustrating but at the end of the day it is very satisfying to see your sweat and tears come to fruition</p>
