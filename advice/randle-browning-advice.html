			<h4>You are technical! And I love sherbet.</h4>
			<p>"Technical" is a mindset, not a character trait. All you need to do is flex your techy muscles. Before you know it, you'll be thinking like all the nerds.</p>

			<p>That doesn't mean it's going to be easy! We all learn in different ways and at different rates. If you want it, you can do it. But we all take different roads.</p>

			<h4>GET TECH FRIENDS</h4>
			<p>Remember all the annoying theater geeks in high school? How they all wore eyeliner together and walked around in a jaded group? That's what you need. Techies. You'll recognize them by the hunch in their shoulders, the bags under their eyes, the empty coffee cups, and their periodic fist pumps.</p>

			<p>You need these crazy pals to help you when you're stuck, encourage you when you're floopy, and to spread the word about your new skillset. Your goal is to get all the gold coins right?</p>

			<p>Do a little each day instead of a lot one day. Brains aren't that great at cramming. We learned that AGES ago.</p>
