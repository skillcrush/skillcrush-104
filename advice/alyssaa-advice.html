			<h4>Fundamentals!</h4>
			<p>There is a ton of information to learn, and each step builds upon the previous one. Be sure that you have a solid understanding of the fundatmentals.</p>

			<h4>Go slowly!</h4>
			<p>Similar to the above, you want to give this time to sink in!</p>

			<h4>Actively explore!</h4>
			<p>Experiment and explore as much as possible. Review others' code and set challenges for yourself. The more you experiment, the more problems you solve, the deeper your knowledge base will become!</p>
