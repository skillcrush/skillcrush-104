			<h4>Don't give up</h4>
			<p>Yes it's scary to be unemployed and trying to learn. But don't give up because of this! Getting a "temporary" job just makes it more difficult to learn to be able to get the job you actually want!</p>

			<p>So, just do it. Suck it up for a few months. Be broke. Live small. Learn lots and poor your heart into it!</p>

			<h4>Use your resources</h4>
			<p>Don't be afraid to ask for help. Everyone started out as a noob at some point, as far away as it may seem. Everyone thinks differently, and might have different ways of solving youre problem.</p>

			<p>Listen to what everyone has to say, whether you agree or not. Can't hurt to learn something new ;) </p>
