			<h4>There Are Shortcuts in Terminal!</h4>
			<p>It's really annoying to not be able to put the cursor wherever you want in a line of Terminal commands, to have to arrow-key right or left to get where you want. Fortunately, you can (on a Mac) use Option + the right or left arrow key to jump whole words and get where you want to be in the line more quickly. Huge time-saver. Cheers!</p>
