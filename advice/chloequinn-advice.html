		<h1>Hi my name is Chloe! Here is some newbie programming advice for you!</h1>

			<h4><span>* </span>Everyone Has to Start Start Somewhere<span> *</span></h4>
			<p>You are going to be frustrated and want to throw your computer across the room. You are going to want to quit. You are going to feel like you will never understand what's happening.</p>

			<p>We have all been there. Making mistakes, confusion, and broken code are how we learn. The truth is, you'll never stop learning as a programmer so I think it's best that you get comfortable with the experience of failing and trying over and over. And remember, we've all started somewhere. We've all had to practice the skills we've developed to get to where we are today, regardless of what they may be. And that applies to coding as well. Just imagine looking back on these experiences in two years. Who knows where you'll be?</p>

			<h4><span>* </span>Immerse Yourself in Community Activities<span> *</span></h4>
			<p>I have found the coding community to be immensely supportive. Most major cities have fantastic Meetup groups, workshops, hackathons and more, encouraging aspiring programmers and designers to come together. I have personally attended workshops for teaching women Ruby on Rails (RailsBridge & Rails Girls), and Meetups like Girl Develop It. Everyone who attends these meetings understands what it is like to be a newbie and they really want to help enthusiastic people learn. Plus, you might just make a friend or two.</p>

			<h4><span>* </span>Search, Search, Search<span> *</span></h4>
			<p>Stack Overflow the heck out of your questions. Google like a maniac. Read programming books and online resources like blogs. Informational interviews with interesting companies can also help you explore which skills you need to develop to be a viable candidate.</p>

			<h4><span>* </span>Face the Tech Head-on<span> *</span></h4>
			<p>Don't be afraid of technology or technologically-minded peeps. Sure you are going to come across those programmers or designers who seem crazy smart and amazing and you practically want to bow at their feet. But hey, don't compare yourself. You can get there too. Like I said before, this requires patience, diligence in the midst of failure, and curiosity.</p>

			<h4><span>* </span>Take Time for Yourself<span> *</span></h4>
			<p>This is an important tip that many people forget, especially when they start out. When you're first learning, it is easy to dive in headfirst and try to cram all the material you can into your mind for hours upon hours. But, as I personally know, this leads to boredom and lack of focus. Take things in chunks. Try to do a little bit of coding/design each day instead of several hours only once a week. The consistency and routine really pays off.</p>

			<p>The other point of this blurb: know when to take breaks. Time away from the computer can work wonders, especially if you have hit that point where you are stumped and stuck. Like any other muscle, our brain needs rest and time to recuperate. Let yourself put the task away for the day and come back to it tomorrow. It is OK to not have it all figured out. A fresh perspective may be just what you need.</p>
