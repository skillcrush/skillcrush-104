			<h4>Live, Learn, and Love Git and Git Hub!</h4>
			<p>I know, for those of you who are on the learning path of becoming a developer, learning how to code is fun and at times can be a challenge. I have been there and still there. It is especially challenging when you are trying to keep a track of all the modifications that you are making by copying the working folder that you are on, renaming it, and keeping it on your desktop, like I used to do. That was before I learned how to use Git and its companion Git Hub. Trust me these two tools will be your friend.</p>

			<p>Yes, I know learning something new like this can be a bit of a curve ball, having to remember to use Git Bash, if on PC, or your Terminal, if on MAC, to make directories, then initiate the directory, then add your files to your working directory, then commiting them, and then repeating the process over and over again, but trust me, it is all worth the extra work. Knowing this time saving tool and how to use it will save you hours of fustration, tears, and possibly destroying your hard drive, "Cough, cough," when you accidentally delete the file that you are working on or if your code should break for some strange reason, Bootstrap, and having the back up files will keep you sane. </p>

			<h4>With practice, patience, dedication, and time your love for Git and Git Hub will blossom.</h4>
			<p>You might be saying to yourself, "Ugh do I have to learn this, why can't I just keep doing what I'm doing now, it works." Let me just say this to you, if the above reasons did not change your mind about using Git and Git Hub, just think of when you are working with a client and all of a sudden your computer fries, "EEEEK," what do you do then? Or let's say you are running a few different programs in the background and each one is a power and ram hog, besides having three different browsers up and each browser has at least 10 different tabs open, and your playing music. What do you think is going to happen when you try and run something else, your computer is going to freeze, at least mine did. How in the world are you going to unfreeze it when you cannot not do a hard shut down by pulling out the battery and pressing and holding down the power key is not working, you would probably do what I did, smash the hard drive. TADA! The computer is unfrozen and also inoperable, and there goes all the code files you have been working with, right along with the busted hard drive, oh and to just make things worse, you did not back anything up in the cloud or your external hard drive. There you go a real life sceanrio in which I had nothing to save me accept for the fact that I did save some of my work to Dropbox, but everything else is gone.</p>

			<p>Basically, the point that I am trying to make here is, learn to love Git and Git Hub. Spend an hour a day practicing your command codes, learn to infuse it with your everyday work flow, and before long you too will be Gitting away with code murder. Hilarious, I know!</p>
