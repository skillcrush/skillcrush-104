			<h4>Take your time and don't fret!</h4>
			<p>Take your time and read through each lesson.  I know I have the tendency to scan over what I read and jump into trying to do the exercises.  I just want to do instead of taking the time to read everything and understanding the concepts.</p>

			<p>I also think that I am too hard on myself when I don't understand a certain concept.  Be patient with yourself and know that you won't get everything overnight.  It doesn't come by osmosis. I do know that when I do take the time to understand
			then it seems to 'click' better in my brain.</p>

			<h4>Tips on Learning New Concepts</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>Be Patient With Yourself</li>
				<li>Take a Break - Walk Away When Frustrated</li>
				<li>Laugh and Have Fun!</li>
				<li>Get Enough Sleep - 6 to 8 Hours</li>
				<li>Eat Good - Drink Plenty of Fluids</li>
			</ul>

			<p>I know that it sounds funny, but drinking plenty of fluids keeps you hydrated and healthy.  It can hinder concentration, if you aren't well hydrated or if you are hungry.  I've gone along with my lessons and I forget to eat or drink and it doesn't
			help with completing the lessons.  Plus, you want to stay healthy and not be sick.</p>
