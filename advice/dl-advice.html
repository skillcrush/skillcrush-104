			<h4>Always listen to your 3-year old</h4>
			<p>When your 3-year tells you to stop working because you've been working too long then stop. When he tells you to pick him up, pick him up. </p>
			<p>If he wants to stay home from daycare because he doesn't want to miss you all day, let him.</p>
			<p>There are many more where that came from.</p>
