			<h4>Find the right path</h4>
			<p>If you are starting out as a complete beginner like I was, I can't stress enough how important it is to find something that works for you.  For me that meant, after trial and error, realizing I needed a specific, guided class to follow with deadlines and projects.  I also needed to learn from someone that would explain all the little things so I really understood.  I wanted a full explanation of the basics so I could build from there.  Find what works for you!</p>

			<h4>People that are willing to answer your questions are key!</h4>
			<p>It's important to know how to use online resources and tools available to coders to figure things out, but sometimes, especially in the beginning, having a person willing to answer some basic questions makes your understanding much smoother.</p>

			<p>Having someone to say, "Look, you've almost got it" or "You're not too far off here" was an invaluable part of my confidence boosting and that's half the battle, right?</p>

			<p>Don't forget to use all the tools in the toolbox - people, guides, online resources, meetups, the list goes on.  This journey is much better with support!</p>
