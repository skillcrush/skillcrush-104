			<h4>Commit to studying at least two hours a day!</h4>
			<p>Don't procrastinate. Check your daily emails and finish the day's lesson. If you leave it for tomorrow, you will end up trying to catch up with the course and this is not fun.</p>

			<p>So, commit to studying at least two hours a day!</p>

			<p>You will be glad you listened to my advice!</p>
