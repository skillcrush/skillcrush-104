			<h4 class="megmiller-advice">Failure is AWESOME</h4>
			<p class="megmiller-advice">Most people view failure as a negative experience. When you are learning something new, failure is your new best friend. When you are in the zone, and you suddenly break your whole code, you may have an instinct to panic or get angery. However, keep in mind that this is the fastest way you will really grasp the technical aspects of your new skills!! </p>

			<p class="megmiller-advice">Each time you fail, you will learn invaluable skills which may have otherwise taken you years to learn the "traditional" way. In face, failure is the reason most of us are taking these Skillcrush Blueprints to begin with, right!? If we were all able to learn new skills immediately on the first try we would have no reason for classes like these or community or society!!</p>

			<h4 class="megmiller-advice">Learning any computer language teaches you how to think ... again.</h4>
			<p class="megmiller-advice">I wish I would have known that there is a set of rules for coding, but there are also almost infinate ways to accomplish your goal using code. I was so ingrained to believe that there is a "right" way and a "wrong" way, that I often failed to really learn the "why" behind each of my actions. I was just following instructions. Just copying code. </p>

			<p class="megmiller-advice">It wasn't until I realized that I had to <strong>re-learn</strong> how to think in a totally new languge that everything starting to fall into place for me.</p>

			<p class="megmiller-advice">When I would encounter a problem in my code, I looked for typos, but I wasn't always understanding "why" my code was breaking. My biggest piece of advice would be this ... <strong>Don't copy and paste any code you are learning until you totally understand what it's doing!! </strong>Once you have a solid understanding, then you can copy and paste your code around, but my advice is to type it all out first. It will help it get into your brain!</p>
