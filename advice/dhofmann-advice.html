			<h4>Don't give up and take yourself seriously!</h4>
			<p>It's going to be confusing and frustrating especially if you have no computer background like I did. But take yourself serious, don't undermine your determination and talent.</p>

			<p>I take way too long to take myself seriously with anything I start on. I always think that I am not good enough yet. Do not make that mistake. Just dive in and try things. Trust yourself.</p>

			<h4>Be Curious!</h4>
			<p>Be curious and try new things. Have some side projects that you can escape to if you're getting worn out with the course or just need a change of work for a minute to refresh.</p>

			<p>And most importantly: Don't worry! You'll get there. Just be patient and stick with it.</p>

			<p>Now go and get back to coding! Good luck!</p>
