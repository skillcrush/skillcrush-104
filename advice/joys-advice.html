			<h4>Confusion is your parabatai!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before. </p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>The game in ON!</h4>
			<p>This can naturally lead to frustration but as a wise Skillcrush tutor told me when I was just about to throw in the towel: Frustration is just part of the game. This of it like a clue in a detective story and solve the case. Game ON!</p>
			
			<h4>It's a machine</h4>
			<p>I find comfort in the fact that even when I hit a road block, I can groan about it for am inute but when I calm down, its JUST a machine. It still works within the confines of a system of rules. Unlike the Matrix, these can neither be bent or broken. If it's not working, something is not right. PERIOD. Back to being a detective YAY! Does it suck sometimes? Kinda, I often wonder if it's taking me ages when it's just in fron tof me but I've already noticed, my eyes picks up on the correct area to fix faster and faster. Soom, like Cypher, I won;t even see the code anymore, I'll just see, redhead, blonde, brunette ... OK OK OK enough with the movie references. </p>
