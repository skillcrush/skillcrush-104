			<h4>Don't get hung up on which language to learn.</h4>
			<p>No matter which programming language you choose, in an introductory or beginner course, you're going to learn the basic concepts of programming. Those are the essential things, the concepts that you'll use in any and every language.</p>

			<p>The rest is details. Once you understand things like looping, conditionals, arrays, functions, etc., picking up a new language is largely a matter of learning the particular syntax of it and how these concepts are implemented.</p>

			<h4>Practice consistently.</h4>
			<p>Work on a schedule that suits you and that works with the rest of you activities - maybe every day isn't feasible, but a few times a week, or longer study sessions once a week on a day off from work. Leaving several weeks or even months between study sessions will make it hard to get back into it if what you've already learned is fading from your memory. Keep it fresh, and you can call it up more easily when working on a project.</p>

			<p>There are tons of resources out there to learn programming, many of them free, so if you get stuck with one, or just want a little bit of extra practice or a different approach, give another one a try.</p>
