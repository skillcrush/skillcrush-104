			<h3>Do not be intimidated by what you do not know yet.</h3>
			<p>Remember this is a journey, and a life changing one at that. We have goals set and we are on the path to execution of these goals. The light at the end of the tunnel brightens everyday as we get one step closer to the end of this tunnel. But remember, this is a learning process and the learning will never be done. The only way to get through these times of uncertainty is to jump right in and CODE! All of the classes and all of the research is great but do not get so caught up in the information pool that you drown. YOU MUST CODE TO LEARN!</p>

			<h3>Patience, Patience, Patience......wait for it...........have Patience</h3>

			<p>You must settle down and take a breath. Everything does not come overnight, as much as you would like it to. You are not the only person in the world with a job they hate and a mission to leave. I know you have found this <strong>beautiful</strong> passion but all good things come with time. You must remember to know the path you are on and understand it is not a race to the finish but rather a long, glorious journey down a never-ending path. There will be times of storms and winds that try to blow you off track. And in these moments you will feel the need to run faster; <strong>DON"T!</strong> It is in these moments you will learn the most and this will teach you to truly treasure the moments of sunny days strolling along the beach with the salty, sea breeze against your face. Remember to take you time and learn all you can from every instance that you face.</p>

			<h3>Finally, Do not be afraid to go against the grain.</h3>
			<p>Remember that this technology is an art form. There are basic standards to follow but there is also the beauty that comes from within yourself you must let out. Do not be afraid to challenge the establishment and do things your own way. Build what you love and love what you build, if only for yourself. What we are doing is changing the world around us and we are of the handful of people making that happen. Being apart of a growing industry that is having major impacts in the world gives you the leverage to make change. Do not be afraid to make change and do not be afraid to fail. Take the chances with yourself, your art, and your passions. This is unique platform that offers everything to you that you need to make change. So go out, jump in the calm stream, and make a splash in the water of the world. You need nothing more than your ideas and your new-found skill to do it your way and your way alone!</p>
