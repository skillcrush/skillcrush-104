			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>Start off working with people you know. It takes off some of the pressure.</p>

			<p>Having a separate ergonomic chair for coding is great. When you code in bed it's harder to sleep and harder to code.</p>

			<h4>Work on projects</h4>
			<p>This is the fun part! Learning code all day and not putting it to use is like cooking for hours on end and not eating any of it.</p>

			<p>Tea and background music make whatever room you're coding in feel less like a cave. Yes, to the outside world it may seem like I've been hiding in one, but that doesn't mean it should feel like it!</p>

			<p>Backup all your work and expect to make mistakes. A lot of them. But those are the things that you'll remember how to fix the next time around.</p>
