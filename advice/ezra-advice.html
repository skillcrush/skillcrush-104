					<h4>I originally hated software development</h4>
					<p>I was drawn to it out of interest for the field having the potential of being a creative outlet for me (The salary didn't hurt either!), but found the initial dive to be an overwhelming mess. There were times when I gave up out of discouragement, but I somehow found myself gravitating to my laptop, eventually typing away questions involving code that were planted into the back of my mind. A year later, I find that I still know nothing, but not in a a discouraging sense. I simply realize that I have only a basic understanding of how developers operate, and for everything I learn, there's always three times the amount I have yet to discover (to say that's an understatement is, well, an understatement). With that being said, it's an enjoying experience to be apart of something bigger.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="lilbox">
					<h4>Embrace confusion!</h4>
					<p>As you begin programming your first web app, you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
					<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="lilbox">
					<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
					<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
					<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
					<p>When you encounter a new programming language, part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The best way to do so is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="lilbox">
					<h4>Take a break, fam.</h4>
					<p>Although it is admirable to have determination on solving that one seemingly impossible problem, do yourself a favor and take a deep breath, save your work, and TAKE A BREAK. Not only is it refreshing, but <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/8100566/Sleeping-on-a-problem-is-best-way-to-solve-it-say-scientists.html">studies have shown that rest can give your brain the boost it needs.</a> </p>
					<p>Advice I should also take more into consideration at times, it's easier said than done. But not only will you feel refreshed, you may discover that you may have missed a minor detail or an obvious one during the process of overthinking.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="lilbox">
					<h4>Practice, practice, practice</h4>
					<p>this may sound like a contradiction to the previous suggestion, but it's not in the sense that this is a fun requirement rather than a voluntary venture into a frustrating mental maze.</p>
					 <p>That being said, you've most likely heard it time and time again, but if you are to take anything from this little page, it's to always desire to improve yourself in your craft (or everything!). Technology is and will continue to grow at an exponential rate, so it's paramount to be up to date with all things technology.</p>
					<p>Practice even when you're not practicing! To be a developer is so much more than staying glued to a monitor for nine hours a day. A developer is one who knows how to effectively solve a problem in the most effecient way possible! Surround yourself with books, classes, technology, podcasts, anything to get and keep your mental juices flowing.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="lilbox">
					<h4>Don't be afraid to fail</h4>
					<p>I stand against the notion that one can truly master a field, rather they gain greater proficiency in molding their skill as long as they are granted the opportunity of time.</p>
					<p>I make that statement not out of pseudo-philisophical spite, but how it stands true to the world of software development (or any field for that matter). Nobody knows what their doing when they first explore a field unfamiliar to them; It's quite a daunting task to do so, but the rewards that are to be sowed from facing trials of the unknown are beyond satisfying.</p>
						<p><q>The master has failed more time than the beginner ever tried</q></p>
					<p>So don't be afraid of error, as you'll be facing that a plentiful amount of times before you get ahead, and that's the beauty of it! Be courageous and take risks, for who knows what you'll discover? So long as you have the mindset of self-improvement, paired with an insatiable curiosity, you'll be amazed with what you're truly capable of!</p>
