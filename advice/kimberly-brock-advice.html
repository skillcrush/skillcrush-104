			<h4>Everyone starts somewhere!</h4>
            <p>The advice I have for you is to <strong>START!</strong></p>
            <p>Everyone you see that is now an expert, started off knowing nothing. Learning is a process. The best part is that once you start, there will always be people who know more than you who can guide you along, and people that know less than you that need your help!</p>
