			<h4>Do not fear failure!</h4>
			<p>Some people can be set back by a fear of failure,</p>
			<p>that it's too late for them to learn code, it's too hard, or that they won't be good at it.</p>
			<p><span>I say face the fear and do it anyway!</span></p>
			<p>With failure comes growth.</p>
			<p>The master has failed more times than the novice has tried.</p>
