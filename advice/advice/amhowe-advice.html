			<h4>Don't Be Afraid to Dive In</h4>
			<p>When you start learning programming, it can be easy to feel overwhelmed by how all the syntax, logic, and best practices come together to create a web app. The best way to overcome this is simply to create <em>something</em>. It doesn't have to be perfect the first time, and your code will only improve the more you practice.</p>
			<p>Don't let your fear of failure prevent you from trying something new.</p>

			<h4>Build Something You Don't Know How to Build</h4>
			<p>Remember when your dad taught you how to ride a bike by pushing you down a hill and yelling "Just pedal!"? That is how learning to program works. If you don't know how to make a basic to-do list app, but you want to learn, then go do it! Pushing your boundaries and discovering how to overcome obstacles will only make you a better developer.</p>
			<p>Every web app was built by scratch by someone just like you. If they can do it, so can you!</p>
