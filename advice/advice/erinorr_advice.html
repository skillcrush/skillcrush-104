			<h4>Be in the here and now!</h4>
			<p>If your here embrace the moment. You are a learner, thinker, a do'er!  The world is at your finger tips and Google is your closest friend!</p>

			<p>The lure of distance and the difficult is deceptive. The great oppurtunity is where you are. ~ John Burroughs </p>

			<h4>Find opportunity where you are.</h4>
			<p>Some concepts may come easy to you and others will be harder to grasp.  While learning to program try thinking "outside of the box". Embrace every challenge and you will rise above. We create our own opportunities!</p>

			<p>The reward of learning to code is that you can change the world. You can shape the future with the skills you are learning. Share your path and your story!</p>

			<p>Wishing you the best of luck in this journey! The best has yet to come!</p>
