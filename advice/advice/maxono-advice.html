			<h4>Practice, practice, practice</h4>
			<p>Practice writing code at every chance you get.<br />
			Embrace the struggles to figure out solutions to the problems you encounter.</p>

			<p>Don't be afraid to use the resources available to you.<br />
			The harder a time you have coming up with a solution, the better you'll understand why it works.</p>
			<div id="break"><p></p></div>

			<h4>Commit often and clearly</h4>
			<p>Many small commits are better than few, large commits.<br />This will save you time in the long-run if something doesn't work or needs to be changed.</p>
			<p>Additionally, accomplishing one task per commit helps avoid losing track of what you did or why you did it.</p>
