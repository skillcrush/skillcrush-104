			<h4>Imposter Syndrome</h4>
			<p>Yes, imposter syndrome is real and it's not confined to programmers.  You feel like you a fake, a fraud, a total newbie with your new found programming skills.  Who would ever believe that you are a "developer"?  <em>YOU</em> have to believe in yourself and your skills.  Be willing to share your code, take constructive criticism and learn from others.


			<h4>Dog Training and Learning to Code</h4>
			<p>I'm a new dog owner!  What does owning a dog and learning new programming languages have in common?  Commands, of course.  I took my dog to obedience 101 training.  She learned a whole bunch of commands: sit, stay, down, heel, off, no, etc.  I'm learning a whole bunch of "commands" in my journey to become a front end developer.  Now that we both have seen and heard these commands we have to practice them.  My dog forgets to heel sometimes and we practice the "heel" command.  I have to practice my coding skills every day.  Use it or lose it!</p>
