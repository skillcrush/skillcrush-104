			<h4>Coding is for everyone!</h4>
			<p>Honestly, this is the best thing I've ever heard. Whether you are a mother, a doctor, a retired teacher, whoever you are and no matter what your background is, know one thing, YOU can code.</p>

			<p>The only two things you need to start to code are motivation and perseverance. You don't need to have aced your maths in school or have a degree in computer science. Just believe in yourself and practice.</p>
