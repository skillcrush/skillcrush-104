		<h3>It's all about Practice</h3>
		<p><strong>Practice, practice, practice! </strong> <br>I need more practice than the daily activities provided. So I used Codecademy and Code School for extra instruction and practice exercises.</p>
		<p><strong>Read!</strong> <br>Practice is great, but reference books will explain some concepts in more depth</p>
		<p><strong>Stick to a schedule.</strong> <br>It's easy to get behind and rush through it. But doing everything once a week means you won't retain much. Set a schedule and stick to it!</p>

		<h1>Good Luck!!</h1>
