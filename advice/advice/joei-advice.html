			<h3 class="joei-advice">You are going to feel lost</h3>
			<p class="joei-advice">When you start programming you are constantly going to feel lost. This is OK. You will learn as you go, and eventually you will understand.</p>

			<h3 class="joei-advice">Bring your patience</h3>
			<p class="joei-advice">Which brings us to our next point, which is that <em>you will have to be patient</em> and accept the difficult learning process. It's not impossible. But it will challenge you - likely well outside of your comfort zone. Just hang in there and keep moving forward.</p>

			<h3 class="joei-advice">Keep moving forward</h3>
			<p class="joei-advice">Yes, just as I already stated, the most important thing is that you keep moving forward and hang in there. No one starts out with all the answers. And guess what, they all had to go through their own process to acquire them as well.</p>

			<p class="joei-advice">We are not born programmers. We work really hard. Code a lot. Read even more. And just keep striving and moving forward in this learning process.</p>
