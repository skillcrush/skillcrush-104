			<h4>Google is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming, you will run into problems. It is very likely that people coding before you have also had the same problem, or something similar. Just Google your problem. You'll find hints or new ideas. Always check what version of the language they are using, too!</p>

			<h4>If you get really stuck, take a walk or sleep on it. </h4>
			<p>There will be times that you get really stuck. If you can't phone a friend or find anything on Google, then take a break! Let your mind work on the problem behind the scenes while you take a nap, take a walk, or work on something else completely different. You'll be surprised what a change of scenery or pace can do for you. </p>
