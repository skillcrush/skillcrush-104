			<h4>Don't take my word for it.</h4>
			<p>Don't just copy the assignments you're given in class. Think of ways you can tweak the code you encounter, and then, most importantly, try them out.</p>

			<p>Seriously, the best way to learn to program is to write programs. Then write some more programs. And then more programs. I think you see where this is going.</p>

			<h4>Let's talk about debugging.</h4>
			<p>Inevitably you will write code that doesn't do what you expect it to do. Very early on, problems can usually be explained by simple syntax errors, but what about when that's not the case?</p>

			<p>The good news is that you've probably progressed from syntax errors to logic errors. The bad news is that logic errors are harder to detect and fix.</p>

			<p>Usually the best thing to do is to start sprinkling output statements throughout your code. Often certain pieces of code hinge on variables having certain values. Chances are that if you're having problems, those values aren't what you think they are. Print them out so you can find this out for yourself.</p>

			<p>It turns out this is a recognized technique with a name. It's called <em>debugging by printf</em>. Although <em>printf</em> is a C term and not a Ruby term, I hear developers in a wide variety of languages call it that.</p>

			<p>Sometimes you will hear people sneer at this technique. Don't listen to them. Literally every person I know who writes code for a living does this at least occasionally. Sure, eventually you'll want to be comfortable with more sophisticated debuggers, but don't worry about it for now. I literally used this technique with a student earlier today, and it helped him narrow the scope of his problem.</p>

			<p>When describing debugging to someone without a technical background, he replied, "Oh, kind of like a detective." That's a great comparison. Like detectives, we often have to solve problems of unknown origin based on what's in front of us. Enjoy the ride!</p>
