			<h4>Take your time!</h4>
			<p>I know you are eager to start programming, but don't rush through it.  Take your time to grasp each concept before moving on to the next.  Otherwise, you will spend the entire course feeling as though you are playing "catch up".</p>

			<p>Don't be afraid to ask for help.  Sometimes that help may come in the form of another forum member, while at other times you may need to Google for answers.  The more specific the question you type into Google, the more likely you are to locate a helpful answer.</p>

			<h4>Believe in yourself.</h4>
			<p>You can accomplish anything that you desire if you believe in yourself and are willing to put in the work that it takes to be successful.  Programming is completely doable if you start at the beginning and master each concept step by step.</p>

			<p>Get plenty of practice.  You will never master programming by just hearing it once.  You need to practice again and again until it becomes second nature to you.</p>

			<p>Make it your own.  After learning a new concept and completing the practice questions or challenges, create your own challenges to make it your own.  Use the concepts you just learned to create your own software programs and applications.  This will make you a much better developer.</p>
