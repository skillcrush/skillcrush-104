			<h4>Everything is a Google Search away</h4>
			<p>When you get stuck, it's good to know that there is always help out there. You can find forums, mentors, fellow coders, and more just by searching for answers to your current problem.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Try something new, even if it's crazy</h4>
			<p>Creative solutions are not always obvious and sometimes thinking outside the box can produce one of the best answers to a problem. If you have an inkling that something will work, don't be afraid to try it. There is rarely only one specific way that you can solve a problem.</p>

			<p>While there are certainly easy and efficient ways to go about certain things, sometimes the craziest, outside-the-box idea is the real winner.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
