			<h4>Shutting Down the Fear of Failure</h4>
			<p>I have always chosen the cautious or "safe" path, but it has not always made me happy.</p>

			<p>Often, this was done out of fear of failure, or fear that I would not stack up to expectations for myself, or of others.</p>

			<p>But I have lived long enough to know that living in fear or in the "safe-zone" isn't going to get you very far.</p>

			<p>Sometimes, you just have to try, and chances are, you will grow and become better from the experience. Very often, you will suceed in someway.</p>

			<h4> Also, take breaks and look at cute animals, corgis and kittens and stuff.</h4>
