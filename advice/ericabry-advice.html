			<h4>This is cool...to me.</h4>
			<p>Everyone's first desire is to create something awesome that you can show someone. Especially if you were good at something in a different field, it can feel like taking steps backward when all you have to show is a tiny snippet of code.</p>

			<p>Building something, even if it's little, is important. Don't forget that everyone had to start out somewhere!</p>

			<h4>Test one line at a time!</h4>
			<p>The first thing I always want to do is immediately build the entire project and then start running it. You know what's hard? Trying to figure out why something is giving an error when it looks right!</p>

			<p>One of the best pieces of advice I ever got was to pick things apart one piece at a time. So I will create a variable from a user's input and then immediately puts the result to make sure that its actually pulling the input. And then I'll continue on this way. It helps me figure out where I am not getting the result I want before I build this whole beast, and don't know where to start!</p>
