			<h4>Organization! Organization! Organization!</h4>
			<p>Print out your cheatsheets. Read your cheatsheets. Love your cheatsheets. Make little dolls out of your cheatsheets. Get to know them.</p>

			<p>Organize all of your skillcrush information in such a way that you can easily refer to each lesson's guides and downloads. Make sure to bookmark websites or google searches that prove helpful as you hit speed bumps during lesson challenges. That way, when you begin to work independently, you can refer back to pertinent terms, instructions, pitfalls, etc, in an efficient, anxiety-abating way. </p>

			<h4>And if all else fails, cry.</h4>
			<p>Or copy and paste error messages into google over and over and over again.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing. And then keep doing that. Until your eyes bleed.</p>
