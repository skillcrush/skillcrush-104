			<h4>Never to late</h4>
			<p>No matter what age a career in Tech is not out of reach. Since there are a lot of remote and freelance jobs available, not one can tell the age behind the screen.</p>

			<p>Be sure to practice everyday to make sure you sharpen your skills</p>

			<h4>You will never learn everything!</h4>
			<p>There are so many new programs that there is no way to learn it all. Things change all the time so you are always learning.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>If it it something that you really want, you can do it!!</p>
