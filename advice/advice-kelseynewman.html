			<h4>Never give up!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming learn slow and PRACTICE a lot! Don't beat yourself up if you don't get everything right the first time. Mistakes are how we learn!</p>

			<p> Confusion is natural, but most questions you have can be answered if you just google it or ask for help from your skillcrush instructors. So just remember why you are learning and NEVER GIVE UP!</p>

			<h4>Keep practicing!</h4>
			<p> Learning new skills and languages can be very difficult and it is important to keep practicing, just like training for a run or learning a language, practice is essential! It is all part of the learning process.</p>
