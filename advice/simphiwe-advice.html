			<h4>When times are hard, don't give up, Just hang in there</h4>
			<p>Learning how to code is not an easy journey, but when you have good guiding platforms like skillcrush, you tend to enjoy it as time goes by and not forgetting the support you get from your fellow classmates</p>

			<p>Giving up is not optional when you want to achieve your goal. Keep trying, keep practicing and you will eventually get it right, and enjoy repeating it and getting creative about it each day</p>

			<h4>Hiccups are always going to be present </h4>
			<p>Learning how to code can be very scary and intimidating when you're a women cause you overlook little mistakes we make and think because of our gender and that the opposite wouldn't make the same mistake, that is just a myth though. If you learned and skilled enough, you are capable of becoming a good developer or designer,regardless of your gender</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>Remember, don't be discouraged, put your confidence face on and be ready to face the world and show them that you're a Kick ass coder!</p>
