			<h4>Patience and Perseverance!</h4>
			<p>When your head feels heaviest, you are making progress!  This moment, you can go and take a break, the important thing is that the next day you come back, and the next and the next.</p>

			<p>I used to think that you had to keep at it, endlessly, but that is not how the brain absorbs new information.  You need to let it percolate for a bit, then push it a bit more.  Pretty much like exercise and weight lifting. </p>
			<p class="sbw-advice">Patience is the key, sometimes you feel like giving up, but let me tell you, its always TOO soon to do that.  Keep at it! :)</p>

			<h4>Cat Ipsum.</h4>
			<p>Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, run in circles for stretch. Run outside as soon as door open lick arm hair and scream at teh bath and nap all day pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space and kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff. </p>

			<p>Sleep on keyboard meowwww or find empty spot in cupboard and sleep all day scratch at the door then walk away. Pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms curl into a furry donut. Sweet beast burrow under covers stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring for toy mouse squeak roll over, jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed. Sun bathe sit on the laptop where is my slave? I'm getting hungry kitty loves pigs. </p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
