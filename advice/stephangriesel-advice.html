			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
		</div>
		
			<p>BUT remember, you must keep practicing. If you code for a week, leave it for weeks then you are going to forget things. Going back and doing research again is just going to waste time. Get in the habit. Remember to code every day, even if it is just for 1 hour. </p>
			
			<p>Get involved with your community. The more you interact with like minded people the better. You don't have to go and join big conferences to be part of a community. Start small, get a group together and code every week for few hours. This will also help you explore new technologies or things you didn't know and maybe your fellow coding friends can also help you with a few challenges you are stuck with.</p>
