			<h4>Confusion is not your friend!</h4>
			<p>Look for a program that works with your learning style so you can understand what you're learning.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you need some help.</p>

			<h4>Expensive programs are not better.</h4>
			<p>There are lots of programs out there to learn to code. Make sure to find what works for you and combine resources.</p>
