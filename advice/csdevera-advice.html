			<h4>Get good at Googling</h4>
			<p>One of the things I love about Skillcrush is how their Blueprint courses guide you step-by-step in their instruction. But, even then, you'll most likely still have questions or need to look something up for reference, such as the hex value for a particular color.</p>

			<p>This is where you need to get good at using Google. It's not just good practice for coding newbies, but for experienced professionals as well. No matter where you are in your coding journey, you're not going to know everything (and it's not expected either).</p>

			<h4>Bookmarking is your best friend</h4>
			<p>So using Google is great, but combining that with bookmarking is even better. Besides the obvious reason of saving you time from Googling the same thing over & over again, you can also refer back to your bookmarks when you want to share knowledge with others.</p>
