			<h4>Patience and Perseverence are Key!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming, everything is going to be very unfamiliar. Do you remember learning a new language in middle school? Frustrating, right? Well, this is the same exact thing!</p>

			<p>Luckily, its even easier. Checking your work along the way is a BREEZE. You can check whenever you like, its not cheating here. Too stuck to find your own way out? Google it! Guarantee the answer is out there. And last, there are no final exams. You don't need to memorize everything up front, resources are out there for your use everywhere. You'll remember the key stuff along the way!</p>

			<h4>Practice often, and don't give up!</h4>
			<p>The best way to improve, in anything in life, is to practice often and this could not be more key in coding. There are a lot of small things that just maintaining a strong practice will engrain in your DNA, and you'll get very proficient in no time!</p>

			<p>Most importantly, do NOT give up on learning more and pushing yourself. First of all, you're never done learning. There are always new programs out there for you to explore, and they're all forever changing! Also, it will take time to find your first job or client, and that's ok! Just keep pushing though, and you will get there in no time.</p>
