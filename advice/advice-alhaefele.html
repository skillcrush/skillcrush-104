			<h4>You Don't Have to Know Everything Right Away</h4>
			<p>When I first started out, there were a ton of things I thought I "should" be able to do, but there is NO should!</p>

			<p>"Just In Time" Learning in Fiiiiiine.</p>

			<h4>Everything you need to know, you can learn when you need it. It's okay to research as you go along, and to struggle to find things.</h4>
			<p>The more you seek to solve a specific problem, the better you'll understand the process as a whole. It's all part of the growth experience :)</p>

			<p>You just have to have a little faith that you will find the answers and that, in the process of looking for those answers, you're picking up other really important knowledge. Nothing is a waste of time.</p>

			<p>You just have to keep going, and keep looking for better and better ways to solve problems.</p>
