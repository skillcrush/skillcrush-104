			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>The best thing you can do is to GOOGLE everything. Make Google your best friend you should even go onto YouTube to make sure you are following all the steps in the right order if things still aren't clear.</p>

			<p>Use every resource within your reach; just because you don't know something now that doesn't mean you can't learn it in under a minute.</p>

			<p>Just because you don't get it in a minute or even in an hour that does not mean that you will never understand how to code it all takes patience and practice.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
