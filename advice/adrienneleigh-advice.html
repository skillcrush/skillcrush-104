			<h4>Be Patient with Yourself</h4>
			<p>It's totally normal to feel stuck, confused, or lost (or a combination of all these things!) as you're learning to code. You're learning new languages, and it can be challenging. However, the challenge is what makes it worthwhile. The difficulty invovled in learning to code, after all, is why developers are paid so well. </p>

			<h4>Take Everything Step by Step</h4>

			<p>How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time! There is a SO much to learn, but if you can take in the material incrementally, you should be able to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Focus on learning a little bit every day, and you'll be surprised by how much ground you can cover in just a few months. </p>
