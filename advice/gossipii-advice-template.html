			<h4>Gossipii Philosophy Advice</h4>
			<p>Take whatever help is offered. Starting out coding was very tedious for me as I would run into several issues and not only did I not want to wait for a response from my Google Group at first, I had problems swallowing my pride to skip past obstacles to hopefully get better understanding from the next lessons. This and a few other mental obstacles held me back from advancing on time with my fellow class members. Another issue I was having was knowing when to stop learning and when to start looking for real world gigs. This was an issue because I obviously needed the money, but I also had a desire to just get started with my coding career, but not enough common sense to do what many programmers have done when learning to code. Focus on real projects, not too many tutorials. So much time has been lost due to my inability to take advice from others.</p>

			<p>I have to say, something else that contributed to not asking enough questions (especially in my Google Group) was a lack of confidence in myself to talk to people that were most likely more ahead in life than I was. I figured my personality and speech-patterns may give that part of my identity away, making it harder to hold a conversation and later a client. It wasn't until later that I realized that I wasn't giving my all to this profession and that for as long as I didn't, my concerns would be true. Soon after, I took up every piece of advice I was given towards placing a career in a remote job by writing down everything from advice videos and guides and my bad habits begain vanishing with each passing day.</p>

			<h4>Some Advice For These Problems:</h4>
			<p>Start interacting with others that are involved with you're profession! You won't get very far by silently doing projects for people. Practice as often as possible to improve you're social presence. Also, if you have a Google Group you can take advantage of, become a daily chatter on it until everyone knows you! This not only will help out you're social abilities, but you're actual coding skills as well.  You can post a question on there and move on to the next page of you're lession to try to clear things up while you wait for a response. Don't spend too much time on these lessons though. Try finding a project you can be passionate about and start exercising your mind with you're skills. Have enough confidence in yourself to advance in you're field, this will make you want to work for the fun of it. I started using Habitica to keep track of everything I need accomplished by a certain time of day and most days, everything gets done now. That makes me feel satisfied to do anything I want for the rest of the day.</p>
