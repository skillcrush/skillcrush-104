			<h4>Horoscopes for the Week of September 11</h4>
            <h5>from <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/09/madame-clairevoyant-horoscopes-for-the-week-of-september-11.html">the cut</a></h5>
			<p><strong>Aries</strong>: This is a week for listening to the sounds that call out through the sky, and the stories that speak to you through time. What does it mean that you’re here, today? What do your bones feel called to do? There’s too much work to be done, too much space, too much feeling. So how, this week, will you choose to spend your time? How will you choose to listen, and how will you choose to speak?</p>

			<p><strong>Taurus</strong>: Some days the world holds its own symmetry, and some days it leans out of balance, leaving you struggling, racing to keep up. Some days the world holds its own shape, and some days it bursts just into strangeness, something unfamiliar and wild that you’re left to make sense of again. You don’t have to know everything, and you don’t have to pretend it’s all easy. Just try to hold fast to your bright living love.</p>


			<p><strong>Gemini</strong>: The world holds so many things you can’t expect, surprises and changes you can’t yet predict. It’s so easy to use your energy trying to look into the future, but remind yourself that you don’t have to know everything now. Give yourself permission just to live, the best way you can, in this uncertain world. You can watch the wild future bloom.</p>
