			<p>Landing that new job is exciting! Congratulations! Starting a new job is energizing, nerve-wracking, and tends to bring out the best in you.</p>

			<h4>Observe and learn about the company and the people.</h4>

			<p>You are ready to go, you want to make the best impression possible, you have all these ideas in your head. Keep a running journal of your ideas. When the time is right, you can boil down the ideas and present them.</p>

			<h4>Keep a great attitude and bounce back from mistakes.</h4>

			<p>Everyone will make a few mistakes, especially in the beginning. It’s best to own them, learn from them, seek advice if it is warranted, and move on with newfound experience.</p>

			<h4>Continue to learn on the job and off.</h4>

			<p>Your job as a junior developer is to learn so that your output and value to the company (and yourself) grows and grows. Every article you read, every new framework you learn, every tool you learn to use all adds to your skill set. Be a sponge to new knowledge, especially from the most experienced developers in your company.</p>

			<h4>Take a rest. Spend Sunday in the sun.</h4>

			<p>Developers tend to be very dedicated to their work and their craft. Take at least one day to rest and reflect on all that you’ve learned. Have a sip of beer and watch the sun go down. Go to bed at a reasonable hour so you are refreshed.</p>

			<p>Have fun!</p>
