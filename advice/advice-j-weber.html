			<h4>Don't give up! You are totally capable!</h4>
			<p>Odds are, everything that you are learning right now is completely new and different than anything you have done previously. Don't beat yourself up for not knowing something and be confident in your ability to problem solve.</p>

			<p>I've definitely hit walls - PLURAL! - because I didn't know what I was doing, yet. With some time, much caffiene, and patience I was able to conquer whatever beast I was working on. You can too!!</p>

			<h4>Give yourself credit</h4>
			<p>You know when you watch a movie and the main character is fighting the fight to change her life and motivational music is playing and one day she looks in the mirror and is a totally different, badass person?? That is YOU!! You're changing your life and that is something that most people just say that want and yet, here you are taking control. GO YOU!</p>

			<p>You are a badass. Don't forget it.</p>
