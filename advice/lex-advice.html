		<p id = "intro"> Hello, I'm Lex, and here are my top tips for Skillcrush newbies:</p>
		<ul >

			<li>Have a flick through of the entire day's content before you dive into working. This way you know what resources are going to be availble for you (cheatsheets and details guidance, for instance). This can stop you making unnecessary mistakes, or worrying that you don't understand something, only to find it explained in much greater detail in the next section.</li>

			<li>Make notes on the things that you're finding tricky - often these become clearer as you progress through the week. Revisit them at the end of a topic, and if they're still not clear, fire up Google, or ask your fellow classmates. If something's still not clear, make sure to address it during Office Hours. </li>

			<li>Have an online presence. I have a seperate account that enables me to take part in challenges such as #100DaysOfCode, and follow others who are learning to code, just like me. It's never too early to start connecting with fellow developers and designers, and following others who are learning keeps me motiviated.</li>

			<li>Worried about colour schemes? Check out the brilliant <a href = "https://coolors.co/" target="_blank">Coolers</a>, a colour generating app that let's you generate random colour schemes, or pinch your favouire colours from images on the web. I truly wish I'd found this app sooner.  </li>

			<li>Practice, practice, practice. There's nothing worse than forgetting things you've spent many hours learning.  Build small side projects (like this), so that you don't forget the basics. Play around on <a href = "https://codepen.io/" target = "_blank">CodePen</a>, flex your Flexbox skills with <a href = "http://flexboxzombies.com/p/flexbox-zombies" target = "_blank" >Flexbox Zombies</a>, learn how to make CSS images (just for funsies) with this <a href="https://coding-artist.teachable.com/p/how-to-make-pure-css-images" target = "_blank">free course</a> from Mike Mangialardi  .</li>

			<li>Most importantly, have fun!</li>
