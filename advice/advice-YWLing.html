			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming, your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
			<p><bold>Surrender! And see what's on the other side for  you.</bold></p>

<!-- this is some text that YWLing added to customize here. -->
			<h4> Judgement can take a step to the side</h4>
			<p><bold>And remember this important thought:</bold> don't make yourself feel bad about your mistakes or falling behind. Yes, this is important foundational stuff, but it's not school. You're not being graded here. If you want to feel bad, maybe that's a sign that you really WANT this (good for you!). But no one is grading you. </p>
			<p> So what's in it for you? And badly do you want what's on the other side?</p>
