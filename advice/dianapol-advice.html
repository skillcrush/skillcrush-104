			<h4>Confusion is your friend and Fear is your enemy!</h4>
			<p>So when you start this course, you will probably be scared and hesitate to jump in on the lessons and along the way you'll be confused on some of the lesson exercise. I been there, trust be don't let fear get in the way, take your time; you don't neccesarily have to complete this in 3-months...no do it at your pace. For me this took 5-6 months to complete this blueprint. So go on, do it!</p>

			<p>"Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction." -Skillcrush. i agree with this quote, if you're not sure about something, just go back to the lesson exercise and skim it or do it again. Eventually, you'll get the hang of it. I'm preety sure not all programmer know everything in a snap. I mean there is alot of coding to memorize, man! so go on, practice!</p>

			<p><span>Most importantly, keep learning and have fun!<span></p>
