			<h4>If you don't like something, learn to love it!</h4>
			<p>Hate and love are two very powerful emotions. By changing how you see something, you can change how you feel about it.</p>

			<p>If you hate the fact that there are problems in your code, find the power and patience to fix them. That feeling of accomplishment when you finally "crack the code" is amazing, and in my opinion makes the initial frustration totally worthwhile and the fruits of your labour that much <i>sweeter.</i></p>

			<h4>Never stop setting goals.</h4>
			<p>When I first started with Skillcrush, I just wanted to wham bam thank you ma'am, learn to code, and get a job. Now, that I have learned html and CSS I've set the goal higher, and I want to learn PHP. I want to learn Javascript. I don't just want a job, I want a great job that I will love!</p>

			<p>I think self-improvement keeps our minds active and in the world of tech, it's a necessity to keep yourself relevant. <b>Never stop learning!</b></p>
