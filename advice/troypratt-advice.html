			<h4>Always Keep an Open Mind!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Keeping an open mind, therefore, is a crucial step in making sure that you are heading in the right direction. If you can keep your mind open, you will always be aware of any new challenges that are presenting themselves to you and you can act quickly and accodingly.</p>

			<h4>If You're Not Doing Something Different, You're Not Doing Anything!</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, always strive to do something new and different and push yourself to be innovative.</p>

			<p>By continuously asking yourself how am I or how can I do this task differently, you're opening yourself up to not only being your best, but coming up with the most spectacular solutions possible in any given moment.</p>

			<p>Heeding advice of this nature can seem easy, but if you really think about it, this advice is actually very profound and if you vow to follow this advice it really can change the entire path of your life in very positve and exciting ways!</p>
