			<h4>How To Stay Motivated When Learning To Code By Yourself</h4>
			<p>So you've started learning how to code using all the resources available to you. At first, you were pumped and excited to learn how to develop websites and applications. You realized you have a knack for coding and believed it was your calling. But then, life started to happen and you had to put a pause on your studying or learn at a slower pace. Next thing you know, you haven't gone back to your studying for a while, and dust started piling on your books and notes. And now, you simply don't have the motivation to restart your studies. If this sounds like you, rest assured. Many of us have been there, including yours truly.</p>

			<p>There are many reasons to study coding independently rather than taking a bootcamp, such as financial ease, self-paced learning, and learning at the comfort of your own home. But unless you have great discipline and work ethics, it is easy to fall off track and feel discouraged from continuing your studies. I am here to tell you that this is completely okay. And if you still have a small desire to learn how to code, that's all you need. You can take as much time as you need as long as you keep going. It's taken me more than a year to complete the courses I've set out to do, and I'm still learning new things everyday. I know a few people who took two years and they've gone on to work for startups or creating a freelance business of their own. So let's dust up those books and reignite that fire.</p>

			<h4>Ways to Stay Motivated</h4>
			<p>These are some tricks that worked for me that might work for you. First, find a spot that gets your creative juices running. It can be your home, bed, the public library, your local coffee shop, park, or a collaborative office space. If you like some background noise, put on some music or find some sites with background noises, like <a href="www.asoftmurmur.com">asoftmurmur.com</a>. Second, create a schedule and try to stick to it as much as possible. If you're anything like me, this is probably the hardest thing to do. But make it work around YOUR schedule. If you're a morning person, consider studying in the morning or early afternoon. If you're a night owl, find a place and time where you can study unbothered. If you're a 9-to-5 worker, what about studying after work for an hour or two or during the weekends? A system can help you to stay structured and organized. </p>

			<p>Another advice would be to start small and not overwhelm yourself with materials. Believe me, I researched for hours and hours and became so overwhelmed with the amount of materials and coding languages out there I started to doubt and panic. But by starting out small and setting manageable goals here and there, your tiny accomplishments will add up in the end, motivating you to keep going. Finally, talk to people. Reach out to online communities, surround yourself with people who encourage and motivate you, or confide in someone you trust. Even if they're not in coding and have no idea what you're talking about or going through, it always helps to have some positive people in your life.</p>

			<p>So these are a few of my advices that helped me through my slump. It may or may not work for you, but everyone is unique. So feel free to try other tricks, and maybe you'll be helping out someone who's going through a similar phase.</p>
