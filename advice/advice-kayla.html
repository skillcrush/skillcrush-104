			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Be Patient with Yourself!</h4>

			<p>One of the hardest parts about learning a skill, for me anyways, is that I am very hard on myself. You're doing something great by learning a new skill and you have to give yourself time to adjust so be patient with yourself and use your resources if anything gets too confusing.</p>
