			<h4>Use as Many Resources as Necessary</h4>
			<p>You may start your coding journey with one program or course.  I have found that whenever I am confused or I don't feel satisfied with the explanation from one source that it is very beneficial to look for an explanation of the topic from at least one additional source, perhaps even two.  This has really helped me fill in the gaps that any one course may have.</p>

			<p>Yes, you may go through the material at a slower pace this way but the goal is to become proficient in the material and to not just be able to mark an assignment as complete.</p>

			<h4>Nothing Beats Building Projects with What You Have Learned</h4>
			<p>While I encourage you to do additional research as mentioned above, I believe it must go hand-in-hand with applying the information you learn in some project form.  This really solidifies all the information you gathered once you put it into practice.</p>

			<p>Again, it may take longer to get through your course but I'm pretty sure the extra effort will be well worth it.</p>

			<p>Also, while you're building these projects I have found it very useful to type ALL code out and not just copy and paste from another source.  It seems to help me really get a feel for what I am doing.  Also, marking up code with comments explaining what each line does and why has really helped me understand concepts.</p>
