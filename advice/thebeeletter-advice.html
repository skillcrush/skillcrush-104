			<h4>I thought it was gonna be <span>easier</span></h4>
			<p>Coding is not ridiculosly hard. The hard part for me has been to be disciplined. So, know this is going to take patience and a lot of time. This is one of the nerdiest things I have ever done and simultaneously one of the things where I seem to be less of a nerd. My smarts are not enough: Hard work is what makes the difference.</p>
			<h4>I thought I was being <span>immediately</span> immersed in a new community</h4>
			<p>This is a yes and a no. The opportunity is there: you have to make yourself visible, useful, and available. I'm not great in forums, I'd rather tweet and write e-mails. Do what feels better for you, but find a way to engage. Code is the perfect mixture of tasks you have to tackle alone and team necessity. </p>
			<h4>I thought my path was going to be <span>clear</span> from the <span>start</span></h4>
			<p>LOL. NO. Although I must admit it: my path is getting clearer. I've noticed the things I like to do and the things I don't like. And I have a better notion not only of the career I want, but also of what I need to learn to achieve it. Therefore, in short: if it keeps motivating you enough to want to learn more about it, <span>you will be fine.</span></p>
