			<h4>Drinking from the Firehose</h4>
			<p>When you first start learning to code, and you begin reading about all of the awesome resources (bootcamps, classes, tutorials, podcasts, blogs, newsletters, people to follow on Twitter, and on and on) - it's easy to get overwhelmed.</p>
			<p>What I recently heard on a podcast was about how it's most important to focus on the fundamentals. Are you solid on HTML and CSS? What about JavaScript? Don't chase the frameworks, or hot new JS libraries unless you understand the basics first.</p>
			<h4>Find Your Tribe</h4>
			<p>You can't do this alone. Well, I suppose you could - but learning to code can be lonely. Get some company. You may be struggling with something another person has before, and if you reach out you'll get to that A-HA moment more quickly.</p>
			<p>If a group looks like it moves too fast for you, look for supportive beginner groups (hint, hint: <a href="http://skillcrush.com">Skillcrush)</a>.</p>
			<h4>Make Something Already!</h4>
			<p>Dedicate a little bit of time every day to learning to code. Jerry Seinfeld's famous <a href="http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret">Don't Break the Chain</a> comes to mind. Even just 10-15 minutes a day where you actually open your code editor and practice is worthwhile. You could try for your own <a href="https://medium.com/@richlitt/100-days-of-code-5e9a4dc6d56b#.p8yqx19tt">100 Days of Code</a>. Or try to make a certain number of websites in so many days, like Jennifer Dewalt's <a href="https://jenniferdewalt.com/">180 Websites in 180 Days</a>.</p>
