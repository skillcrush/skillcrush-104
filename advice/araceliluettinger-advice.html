			<h2>Baby Steps...</h2>
			<p>When it comes to coding, I suffer from IWTKEN syndrome - I Want To Know Everything Now! My husband periodically reminds me that every 
			developer started out knowing nothing about coding. It's tempting to compare yourself to other developers
			and where they are on their journey. It seems as though everyone knows more than you do! But no one was born knowing how to
			code. Everyone started at the beginning, and it's important to remember that. </p>

			<h2>Struggling Is a Good Thing...</h2>
			<p>It can be scary starting out on a new venture, especially one in which you're covering unfamiliar ground. Struggling while learning is an
			uncomfortable feeling, but it's actually a very good thing...struggling is where the learning happens! When you come across a challenge, it gives
			you the opportunity to use problem-solving skills and make sense of what you're learning.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="araceliluettinger-advice-third-paragraph">
			<h2>You Don't Have to Know Everything...</h2>
			<p>But you have to love to figure things out! As quickly as technology changes, you cannot possibly know everything. Spending time researching 
			solutions and asking for help are all part of being a successful developer. Plan on spending lots of time on Google. In fact, memorize the
			following six words: Google is my new best friend!</p>
