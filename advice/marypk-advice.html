			<h4>Never stop learning!</h4>
			<p>Once you feel like you have a base knowledge of website development, enough to create your own website, you may feel like "this is it". Don't ever stop there - continue to push yourself and continually strive for growth.</p>

			<p>There are times when you feel like you might know "enough", but there will always be opportunities out there, either new clients or different projects, where a skill may be lacking. Continue to strive for that growth.</p>

			<h4>Continually invest in yourself!</h4>
			<p>It's important to find different avenues for growth. Investing in yourself doesn't always mean spending money on courses. It could be investing time & energy. Whatever you think you need to do to become a better version of yourself, really believe that if you invest time, or money, or energy, it will all be worth it</p>
