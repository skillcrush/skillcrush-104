			<h4>Internet is your friend</h4>
			<p>Learning web development can be quite confusing, especially when you have to do it on your own. Don't be afraid to use online resources/forum or even Youtube. This is how I started learning about all the basics for programming and web design!</p>

			<p>The next step would be to take an online course usually you have to pay for them. Signing up for Skillcrush was one of the best decision that I have made in web design! In less than 4 weeks, I learned so many great things.</p>
            
            <p>My last advice would be to NEVER GIVE UP. Programming can be frustrating and confusing, but at the end of the day, you are creating something that speaks to you. I just love it!</p>
