                    Dude is kinda over the top, but he has a point. It's gonna take a level of commitment. And seriously, if you've come this far than you've already committed, so let's talk about being effective.
                </p>
            <h4>Being Effective</h4>
                <p>
                    If I could go back to when I first started I would:
                </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Get shillcrushing</li>
                        <li>Do it for 1 hour everyday (yes, every single day)</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>
                    Nothing is good like getting good, and that takes consistency. If you take a few days off, or a month, start back where you left off and backtrack if you have to until you find the edge of you competency's growth and begin again. 
                </p>
