			<h4>You can do this!</h4>

			<p>Programming is NOT easy. But once you get the hang of it, you'll start to love it!</p>

			<h4>Imposter syndrome is real!</h4>

			<p> You start doubting yourself and feel like you have no idea what you're doing. No matter how much you know it's never good enough.</p>

			<p>I want you to know that this is normal. You're not alone. Actually most of us go through this but the good news is there are ways to fight self-doubt.</p>
    <ol>
			<p>Claim your title. This will help you feel more comfortable with this new identity.</p>
			<p>Share what you know with other people. You will not only prove to yourself that you DO have the skills but you will also learn more in the process</p>
			<p>Find a community of fellow coders. Once you realize that everyone dealt with self-doubt, no matter how successful they are, will give you a boost of confidence.</p>
			<p>And most importantly, TAKE CREDIT! Once you stop using those little phrases that downplay your knowledge, you will find yourself feeling more confident.</p>
