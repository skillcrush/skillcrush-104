			<h4>It takes longer than you think, but don't give up!</h4>
			<p>I first started on my programming journey over a decade ago.  I have always wanted to build web sites and I tried to start when CSS was new.  (Do you remember <i>HTML Goodies?</i>  I do.</p>

			<p>I'm now 43 years old and finally getting to a point where I believe that I can do this for a living and pick up the skills I need to do this.  For a variety of reasons I've had fits and starts, PHP, ASPX, ColdFusion.  You name it I looked into it.  Various issues and frustrations would cause me to give up, sometimes for a week, sometimes for a year, but I kept coming back, because deep down I knew it's what I wanted. </p>

			<h4>If you believe you can do it - you can - never forget that</h4>
