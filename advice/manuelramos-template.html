			<h4>No one's gonna notice if you're never right or wrong</h4>
			<p>Maybe you know that programming is what you want to do. Maybe, you don't. Whatever the case, if you are taking a chance in skillcrush is because you at least want to checkout what's this all about. And in that case, never surrender trying. The only way to know if this is your thing, is at least trying. After all, people here are not to judge, but to teach and learn.</p>

			<p>And please, don't be afraid to fail. Everybody skips a letter or a symbol in a code. Or just mispells a word. And the whole code stops working. Take a deep breath, and get ready to fail again. Because that is the only way to be 100% sure that you can succeed: Keep trying.</p>
