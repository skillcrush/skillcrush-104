			<h4>Failure paves the path to success.</h4>
			<p>Failing is a sign that you're pushing yourself; the only people who truly fail treat failure as an endpoint. But failure is a stepping stone; it can take you to a new life if you're brave enough to put yourself out there.</p>
      <h4>Also, NEVER</h4>
      <p>
        ...buy into the idea that just because you're female, you're somehow inherently less capable at learning these skills than your male peers, because that is simply not true. Look at Ada Lovelace, Hedy Lamarr, Rosalind Franklin, Marie Curie....you are every bit as badass as any dude (and I'd wager even more so than most, because you know how to live in a society that doesn't believe in you, give it the finger, and do your thing.)
      </p>
      <h4>And when in doubt...</h4>
      <p>
        Take a coffee break. It's amazing how stepping away from a problem can help your brain solve it.
