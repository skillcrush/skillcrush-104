		<h2>Here's some advice for you, <i>Newbie.</i></h2>

		<div class="advice">
			<h4>Quite frankly, you have got to be ready to give up.</h4>
			<p>You know it's been years that you've been thinking about it. Setting your alarm every night, dreading that hour, as it so quickly approaches, when you have to get up and start the grind all over again. Same routine, same path to the office, maybe you stop for that gourmet coffee, maybe you don't, but it's the same every day. Day in. Day out. Makeing certain that you are available to the boss, the team, the job. Stressing about the kids, the husband... Your "other" job.</p>

			<p>You've spent years dreading it, and now you're ready to give up. You can't stand the idea of answering to another under-appreciative executive who has really no idea what you contribute but freely takes credit for the success meanwhile seems to derail your efforts at advancement.</p>

			<h4>Count to 10 and start over again.</h4>
			<p>It's gonna suck. You will find yourself sitting there at 2 am, in the dark room lit only by the glare of your screen. You can't sleep. Your obsessed. When you do sleep, you dream in code. Something is is wrong with the code and you can't figure out why. You've inspected every line and have ran your debugger more taimes that you can remember.</p>
            
            <p>All you can do is walk away. Go do something different. Read something that has nothing to do with code. Take a shower, play some solitair. Just stop thinking about it. Go pour yourself a fresh Dr Pepper, thumb through that magazine your daughter "accidently" stole from the check-out line, take a deep breath and count to 10.</p>
            
            <p>Then, when you least expect it, while you're taking a shower, drinking that Dr Pepper, the solution will come to you. Out of nowhere, you will have clarity. An epiphany will descend on you like a bolt of lightening. You will be full of energy, motivated to conquer that line with the error. You will rewrite it and it will work perfectly.</p>
            
            <p>Until the next line...</p>
