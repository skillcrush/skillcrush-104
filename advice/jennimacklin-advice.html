			<h4>Anyone can learn to code!</h4>
			<p>Coding can seem really overwhelming to those who aren't familiar with it, and many people have said to me "Oh, it's so cool that you know how to code. I could never do that!"</p>
			<p>But they can, and so can you! It may seem scary, or complicated, or even impossible, but it isn't! I promise.</p>
			<p>When I first expressed this sentiment, that learning to code is easier than it looks, my friend (and fellow developer) vehemently disagreed. "That's just not true!" Said he, "Coding is really hard and not everyone can do it. So there."</p>
			<p>Please, I beg of you, don't listen to that guy! You can learn to code. Sure, some aspects of computer programming are more difficult than others, that much is true. And you can get into some very complex and highly challenging subjects like Artificial Intelligence. But you know what? You don't START there! No one does.</p>
			<p>You start at the beginning, just like everyone else. Just like the above mentioned developer friend. You CAN do it. You just have to start! Maybe you pick up a little HTML or CSS here, some JavaScript there. And before you know it, you are coding like a champ!</p>
			<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Don't listen to the haters. Anyone can learn to code. Start with the basics and go from there. Maybe you love working with HTML and CSS and you decided to stay there and become a boss web developer (Go, you!) or maybe you decide you want to explore programming more and you try your hand at back-end development or making mobile apps. Either way, you did it! You learned how to code.</p>
