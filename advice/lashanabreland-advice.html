			<h4>It may not feel like it, but <span>Confusion is your friend!</span></h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.
				Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>It's OK to walk away, but dont give up!!</h4>
			<p>Frustration is undoubtedly going to happen at some point, and it's perfectly ok to walk away for a few minutes. Just to give yourself a break. Sometimes just being away from it, will help you to see where an issue was when you come back.</p>


			<h4>Celebrate even the smallest victories!!</h4>
			<p>It can be easy to get caught up in trying to complete the big picture. But it's really important to remember to celebrate even the smallest achievements. Especially when your first starting out. If you can celebrate achieving the small pieces it makes completing the Big
					project that much more enjoyable. </p>

			<h4>If all else fails...Google!</h4>
			<p>It's important to remember that there are literally hundreds of thousands of resources out there for you to learn from. There is no problem that you can face that someone else hasnt already come across,
				 and they've either already solved it, or can help you to better understand what your facing, so that you can be the one to solve it on your own. So, if ever you feel truly stuck or lost, remember there's help
			 		just a mouse click away. </p>
