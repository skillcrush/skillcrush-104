			<h4>Sometimes it's the simple things</h4>
			<p>You can spend minutes or even hours staring at code, wracking your brain about what's wrong with your logic when all along it could be a simple syntax error!</p>
			<h4>Take a break!</h4>
			<p>Speaking of staring at code for hours, I'm sure we've had our moments. Stuck on a issue you can't seem to solve it no matter how many times you run through the logic. Sometimes it's best just to take a break! This could be applied to any project in life but it's best to take a step back, relax, go out get some coffee, and face problems feeling renewed.</p>
