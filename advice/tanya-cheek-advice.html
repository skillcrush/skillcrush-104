			<h4>The only dumb question is the one that does not get asked</h4>
			<p>Starting out gung ho and ready to go is great. You are going to want to show that you are capable of doing this, ON YOUR OWN.</p>

			<p>Remember that instead of reinventing the wheel it is better to learn from those who have gone through it before you. Take the advice they have to offer. When they ask if you have any questions, don't be afraid to say yes and then go through those questions.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
