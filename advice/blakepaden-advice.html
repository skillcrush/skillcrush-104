			<h4>Always look over your work!</h4>
			<p>When you first start programming you will have trouble getting your site to look they way you want it on your first try.
				The best thing you can do is look over your code and see where the issue is. You will find that a lot of mistakes were just simply misspelling or forgetting to add a tag.</p>

			<p>If your code looks fine to you and nothing looks wrong then check your code in a validator.
				It it always best practice to do this regardless to make sure you did not forget to add or close a tag somewhere. I have been using W3 and it has worked very well for me.</p><br>

			<h4>Never be afraid to ask for help!</h4>
			<p>When your start down whatever field you choose to go into whether it is design or development your will find many struggles or something may not work out like you want it to.
			It is always good to ask from help from your instructors or from your colleagues.</p>

			<p>There are also online resources out there as well. One of the one's I rely on quite well is the color site EasyCalculation.com</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
