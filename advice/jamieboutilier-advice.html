			<h4>Go SLOW! </h4>
			<p>When I started Skillcrush I wanted to zip through everything so I could finish and be a <span>tech wiz </span>asap!</p>
			<p>I quickly learned that this was the wrong mindset!</p>
				You can't "gloss over" anything in your courses because you will definately need that knowledge down the road.</p>
				 Everything is important and relates to <span>everything</span> else!</p>
<ul>
			<li>Go slow! Take your time with each and every task - there are no shortcuts.</li>
			<li>Read and re-read everything (a lot of times).</li>
			<li>Watch and re-watch and re-watch videos!</li>
			<li>Stop when you don't understand something! Don't move on! You will come
					across the same issue again - guaranteed!</li>
			<li>Use as many resources as you can to help you understand something before moving on.</li>
			<li>Don't be afraid to start something over! It can only help give you a deeper understanding and more practice. </li>
		 <li>Stay motivated and always reflect on the tremendous amount of new skills that you've already obtained!</li>
		 <li>Never stop learning!</li>
</ul>
