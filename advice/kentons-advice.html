			<h3>It's going to be hard</h3>
			<p>Seriously, there will be times were you're going to want to hit your head against the wall. Just know that not only have we all been there, we occasionally are there as well.  </p>

			<h3>Seek out help</h3>
			<p>Attend meetups, get involved with people on reddit, seek out any mentors you can. Practice and ask questions like your life depended on it. The only stupid questions are the ones you don't ask.</p>

			<h3>Some thins you'll love, others you won't</h3>
			<p>Look, you're not going to like everyone 100% of the time. Take me for example. I'm not really interested in CSS/styling pages. I don't have the artistic eye for it. Instead I just make it fun. Take this page for example, yes, it looks like it was made in the "early 90s!" That made me smile so I created it.</p>

			<p>Just Keep being yourself. Stay focused. It will all work itself out.</p>
