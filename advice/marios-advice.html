			<h4>Coding takes plenty of patience and time, but can be mastered!</h4>
			<p>At first when you start programming you think you've entered a journey that never ends. After we get the basics though I feel like it's very straightforward.</p>

			<p>In my opinion being a good programmer is knowing how to do good Google searches and looking for help when you need it. Finding the right resources out there is key!</p>

			<h4>Steps to take when starting out to see if you have the patience and right mindset for coding.</h4>
			<p>Look up free resources on Google like Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, GA Dash and etc. to see if you dig it and go through some tutorials. :)</p>

			<p>If you like it and feel like you would love to do it as a career start looking into some paid training. Sign up for a coding bootcamp and complete it. :)</p>

			<p>Your last step would surely be to go hunt for a job in the city or work on your own.</p>
