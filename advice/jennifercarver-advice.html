	</header>

		<section id="advice">
			<h4> Start with why</h4>
			<p>Watch Simon Sinek's famous Ted Talk video <a href="https://youtu.be/u4ZoJKF_VuA" target="_blank">Start With Why</a>. Everyone has a why... <br> a reason to get up in the morning, a reason to exist, a purpose, cause or belief that inspires you <br> to do what you do. Figure out your 'why' and you'll have a much easier time <br>staying inspired and focused through the tough times.</p>

			<h4>Accomplishing things together <br>is better than going it alone</h4>
			<p>At one point, everyone was a beginner...everyone, so chances are good that problems <br>you encounter have been hashed out by thousands before you. Remember - we are all in this<br> together! Don't be too shy to reach out for support. In time you will come full circle <br>and you'll be the mama bird;-)</p>

			<h4>Come up for air</h4>
			<p>Sometimes we hit a wall and that's okay. Move on - go for a walk.<br> Grab a bite to eat. Have a nap. Start learning something new. Whatever you do, <br>just take a break. The answers will come when your mind is fresh.</p>
			<h4>Have faith</h4>
			<p>There will be many times when things will be about as clear as mud. <br>Stick with it, as you progress through the learning process and do things a few times,<br> it will start to make sense. Just trust.</p>
