	          <h4 class="centered-text">Don't fall down a rabbit hole</h4>
	          <p>It's not possible to learn and retain everything there is to know about
	          programming at once. When you're working on something it's easy to get
	          hung up on unfamiliar terms and concepts and want to know everything
	          about them. This often leads to following link after link about many
	          other concepts, and before you know it you're researching something
	          completely different!</p>

	          <p>When you're working on something, research and learn
	          just enough to get your project done. Make a note of unfamiliar concepts
	          you'd like to learn more about and look them up later when you have free
	          time.</p>
	  			</div>

	        <div class="tip">
	          <h4 class="centered-text">Stop doing tutorials</h4>
	          <p>Tutorials are awesome and a great way to begin your coding journey, but unless
	            you start working on your own projects you won't truly learn to program
	          independently. Step away from the tutorials and work on something that
	          interests you.</p>

	          <p>Just keep making things and eventually the stuff you found difficult
	          at first will become second nature. Start small and don't overwhelm
	          yourself.</p>
	        </div>

	        <div class="tip">
	          <h4 class="centered-text">Take breaks</h4>
	          <p>Give your brain a chance to rest and you'll remember more than if
	            you try to cram everything into a single learning session.</p>
