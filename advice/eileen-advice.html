				<h2>Everyone Else is Faking It</h2>
				<p class="setup">Learning to code is a constant learning process. No one around you comepletely understands what they are creating and how it will run. They will take a stab at it, run it and wait to see what happens. If it's broken, then they take another stab at it, run it, and wait to see what happens. Once it runs, they will look for more things to stab at. And do it all over again.</p>
				<p class="result">'Everyone Else' is just comfortable with this process. Their confidence lies in the belief that they can eventually make it work.</p>
				<p class="go-ahead">Go ahead, take a stab at becoming 'Everyone Else'!</p>
