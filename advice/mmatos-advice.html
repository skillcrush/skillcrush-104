			<h4>Take Your Time</h4>
			<p>Learning is not a race. It's not a rush to get as much into your brain as possible and hope that some of it sticks. It's not a caffeine driven insomnia fest with a test at the end and no other practical purpose.</p>

			<p>No, you are learning skills that can change the course of your life. You want to take your time. You want to make sure that you understand each step, to listen to what others who have walked this path before have learned, and learn from their mistakes.</p>

			<h4>You Will Make Mistakes</h4>
			<p>And you know what, that's OK! You are not superhuman. No one expects what you are doing now, while you are learning, to be perfect. That's why its called learning, and practice. That's why they are here to help you.</p>

			<p>And even going forward, you will still make mistakes. You will not suddenly be perfect at the end of this. And that is OK too. Take your time, check over everything, and do what you can to be professional. But you don't have to be perfect.</p>
