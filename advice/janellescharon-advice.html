			<h4>Mistakes will expand your coding skills!</h4>
			<p> Mistakes are the gateway to problem solving efficiently and effectively.</p>
			<p> Mistakes bring on confusion, but that is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's like being in the forest and wondering why or how to not get lost. The trick is to embrace that programming is better done with curiousity and checking out unknown and walked paths. In the process you get to know what works for all and what you can do that is unique. </p>
			<h4>When you get tired, pause and come back.</h4>
			<p> Making mistakes will feel tiresome and frustrating but this will make you stronger and more eager to code.</p>
			<p> The cloudy understanding will become clearer, and you will see that you may be overlooking the simple answer.</p>
			<h4> Don't go solo...pair, collaborate and borrow!</h4>
			<p> When you feel blocked by mistakes or confusion, check out other codes to see what you are missing or how to simplify.</p>
			<h4>Let your mistakes inspire you and your intuition guide you. </h4>
			<p> You will find that as your eyes and mind train to understand and apply code, you become better and quicker.</p>
