			<h4>You will want to pull your hair out during this journey but don't quit!</h4>
			<p>I have had many evenings during the last three months where I just wanted to quit.  It's too hard!  I am too old to figure this out!  I am never going to learn this!</p>

			<p>I had no developer skills.  I have been an auditor for 28+ years.  I needed a change in my life.  Call it a mid-life crisis!</p>

			<br>

			<h4>Keep plugging away at this because it will be worth it!</h4>
			<p>I have a new appreciation for all of the work that goes into the websites that I visit every day.  I had no idea what it took to design and develop code for a website.</p>

			<p>I am amazed by what I have learned in three months!  At age 50!  You can teach a "older" dog new tricks!  Who knew?  Thank you Skillcrush!</p>
