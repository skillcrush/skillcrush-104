			<h4>Keep On Hacking</h4>
			<p>You will hear this a hundred times on your journey to learn and master development. Whether it is HTML, CSS, Javascript or backend languages like ruby hack something everyday. Build, try new things, or dissect someone else's code. Things will get easier this way. You will begin to start committing processes to memory and exponentially grow you skill as a developer.</p>

			<p>This title "keep on hacking" was something I grabbed from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners">DevTips</a> fantastic resource that I have used in my journey to learn development alongside Skillcrush. Travis shares in one of his videos why he says "keep on hacking" at the end of every video and it is a powerful video. It shows where he was when he first began developing websites and his journey to where he is now. <i>P.S. - Where he is now just happens to be a designer for Google.</i> You can view the video here:<br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLbUzwxkwHA">My First Websites Were Horrible! [ SHOWCASE ]</a></p>

			<h4>Do Not Be Afraid To Jump Into Preprecessors</h4>
			<p>Two of the traits I have picked up that all desireable developers have are DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) code and quick code. That is exactly what preprocessors were made for. As front-end developers you should not be afraid to constantly learn and keep up with new methods for efficient programming. Preprocessors take a little to initially get setup but are worth it.</p>

			<p>Do not be afraid of the new syntax options and new tools for speeding up your workflow. Preprocessors are built so that you can still type in regular CSS and it will work. This way you can slowing add in new tools without having to completely learn a new language. My personal favorite is SASS. Check it out.</p>
