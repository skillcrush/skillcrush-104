				<h4>Check out the Skillcrush forums often...</h4>
				<p>...whether you have a problem or not! Leaning on peers and instructors for help is a fantastic way to get help with your specific problem if you haven't been able to find an answer to your issue by searching online. </p>

				<p>But even when you don't have an active problem, it's good to visit the forums from time to time for a few reasons:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Helping other people troubleshoot their problems not only helps them out, but it helps you build your problem-solving and debugging skills!</li> 
					<li>Answering other people's questions is a great way to solidify your own comprehension of a topic, as reviewing what you know in a real-world context can help your brain transfer the concepts from short-term to long-term memory storage.</li> 
					<li>On top of all that, interacting in the group helps you build a community of supportive peers who can act as collaborators, sounding boards for new ideas, and motivation to keep advancing. </li>
				</ul>

			<div class="tip">
				<h4>Spellcheck first.</h4>
				<p>Before you do go posting a question on the forums, double check your code and the source code to make sure everything in your version is spelled and formatted correctly. I catch 75% of my potential questions at this stage!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="tip">
				<h4>Don't lose your momentum.</h4>
				<p>Finding time to code can be really hard, but it's really important that you don't go more than a few days without working on your code, especially if you're in the middle of a project or learning a tricky new concept.</p>
				<p>Picking up where you left off is way <em>way</em> harder if you don't have a fresh memory of what you were doing! Letting too much time pass between coding sessions is a surefire way to make yourself more frustrated and make your projects drag on, because you'll have to keep looking back at previous lessons.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="tip">
				<h4>Make it personal.</h4>
				<p>When you do have an extra few minutes to work on a project, use that time to play and explore what you've created. Try a new effect you found online, customize colors and layouts, and edit your copy so that it reflects your voice.</p>

				<p>Taking the extra time to customize and experiment with your designs is a perfect way to practice the concepts you've just learned. It can inspire you to connect more deeply with a project, help you develop your own personal style, and give you something to be proud of!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="tip bottom-tip">
				<h4>Above all... Don't. Give. Up.</h4>
				<p class="important">Have fun and happy coding!</p>
