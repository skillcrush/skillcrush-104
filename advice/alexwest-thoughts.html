			<h4>Too much information can be a bad thing</h4>
			<p>Learning new skills by self-teaching is an undertaking. Staying with the subject after the newness wears off is impressive. After you have done both of those things and the realization that you have focused on the wrong information or information that will come to be useful at a later point and is irrelevent at the moment is the problem that I came into the tech world with. There is an abundance of information from so many different sources that becoming overwhelmed is not only a guarantee, but a safe bet -if betting was ever safe.</p>

			<p>I will confess that the basics of html/css/javascript/ruby have stayed in my brain because I have been learning from such a large information pool and consistent repetition of basics is the correct way to learn. However, based off of my experience, the solution to this force of knowledge that the internet gives us can only be met with finding what type of consistent program works for you and proceeding, at all costs, with everything you have to give. So, if that be an expensive bootcamp, a mentor, college, or self-teaching, which may be a little of everything, find what you need to make the learning happen and be able to say you accomplished what you set out to accomplish.</p>

			<h4>Talk to people that know more than you do</h4>
			<p>I love knowledge and the accompanying competence that information provides. However, my preference for learning is to teach myself thru reading and my own experiences. This method, I have come to realize, is less effective depending on the subjects complexity. Such as, learning to crochet with this method works extremely well. Learning to code is not the same case. Crocheting is pretty basic with stitch concepts and the materials needed are easy to aquire. Coding a website with basic concepts in html/css and spitting out "hello world" for the first time are easy. The problem arises when you go beyond html/css to learn a new language or what tools you need for publishing your salutation on the web.</p>

			<p>People with more experience simply know more. And you should be relentless in your pressing them for knowledge. This doesn't mean every person will be willing to talk to you, but upon finding someone who does, USE THAT RESOURCE! Because that's exactly what they are, living, breathing experience that can help you understand things in minutes that might have taken you months or years. So, ask questions and if you don't know enough to ask, ask what they would have asked when they didn't know what to ask.</p>
