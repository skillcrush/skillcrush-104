			<h4>Don't forget why you started!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming, it becomes overwhelming. You wonder if you will ever make it or if you are wasting your time. It seems to double your workload (especially if you work full-time). Don't quit. it is hard now, but the payoff will come, trust the process.</p>

			<p>Your reasons will be what push you through. Write them down. Create a vision board. Don't give up on what you want because it is daunting now. It's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because the rest of your life awaits you.</p>

			<h4>Don't rush to get done first.</h4>
			<p>These classes are awesome! They make it easy to follow, but it also makes it easy to cheat, and you will only hurt yourself. Don't move on just because you can, redo a project (or 2, or ten!) until you fully understand WHY you are doing something. It WILL pay off.</p>

			<p>The classes build. If you are iffy on one section, each subsequential section will be harder, soon you will have no idea where you go lost.</p>
