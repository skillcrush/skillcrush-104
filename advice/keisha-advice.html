			<h4>Wild Ideas are Possible... Later.</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>You may have set out to achieve a goal derived from a wild imagination and you want that to be your first achievement. <span>HOLD YOUR HORSES!</span> Learning the bits and pieces takes time and trying to skip ahead to make that idea happen without the skill base will only leave you time consumed. It is ok to scale back and allow your first project to be something much less than what you dreamed. The dream will come and will likely evolve into something you didn't expect once you begin to learn new skills.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
