			<h4>Even the Best Laid Plans...</h4>
			<p>When I first began with Skillcrush, I was 8 months pregnant and gung ho about being able to work from home by the time my son arrived! I was going to power through my lessons, and be able to work on freelancing as soon as possible so that I wouldnt have to go back to my hum drum job at Starbucks and have to leave my baby behind! Unfortunately things did not work out quite how I expected..</p>

			<p>After a labor that did not go the way I had hoped with an emergency c-section, I found myself faced with a very long recovery ahead of me. I had hoped that I could jump back into my work shortly after my son was born, but life happens as we all know and my labor wasnt the end of my hardships for sure.. With his issues with nursing and my healing, I really was not prepared for the turn around my life had taken, and so just now I have restarted my classes almost 4 months later.</p>

			<h4>Perserverance is Key!</h4>
			<p>Even after all the sleepless nights, the pain, the exhaustion and the tears, every second was worth it because I did things that I had no idea I could do, and I went places internally that I had no idea I could reach emotionally!</p>

			<p>My son has brought me so much joy and happiness, I know now that even when I go back to work, I am going to live in JOY knowing the gift that is waiting for me at home! I'm going to continue to perservere so that I can reach my goals with this class, and in that way shall I achieve my dreams of financial freedom and stability for my family.</p>

			<p>It is in that vein that I encourage any and all people, especially young women to pursue coding, because what life can't teach you about coding, coding can teach you about living! At least the art of it ;p</p>

			<p>So whether it pertains to a line of HTML, or navigating new parenthood, no matter what happens or how frustrated and confused you may feel, always keep pressing on! You will surprise yourself with your strength and what you understand at the end of the day, and the feeling of pride that overwhelms you is MORE than worth it.. it's everything!!</p>
