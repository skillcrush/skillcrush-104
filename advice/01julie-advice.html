			<h4>Find What Works For You</h4>
			<p>Personally I take notes. I take physical pen and paper notes, and I feel like it really helps me. Specifically with Git and Github. I try to use the terminal daily to push and pull to Github, but inevitably I forget a few days and I get rusty. So I have a notebook with easy to find reminders of the correct git commands that I need!</p><BR>

			<h4>Take What You Know and Teach Someone Else</h4>
			<p>Another thing that really helps me is typing up what I've learned into a blog post. This blog post is like a captain's log for me personally, so when I am trying to do something I've done before and I just can't remember what I'm doing wrong, I can consult myself!<BR><BR>

			I used to do this in high school too. I would take notes in class, but then closer to an exam date, I would re-write my notes (often on the computer) and print them out once they were color coded and written more eloquently. The act of re-writing and re-teaching yourself the code or lesson is invaluable. It seems like extra work, maybe, but it's exciting when I can write about what I've learned so eloquently!</p><BR>
