			<h4>Confused?  Don't Let it overwhelm you!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. Confusion typically comes with learning something new.  The best part is there is always help available.  Most times you can goole search and find the answer that you are looking for.</p>

			<h4>If you don't believe in yourself, let that go.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>Don't give up, keep playing with what you are doing.  If you need to take a break and work on something else and then come back.  Typically, the problem is so simple, but you just needed a break to come back to it with fresh eyes.</p>

			<p>You aren't going to learn to code overnight.  You need to work with it everyday.  Know that coding is always changing and that's okay, but you need to be involved in it on a daily basis.  Just keep sticking with it, I promise if you aren't understanding right now it will eventually start coming together, it just takes repitition.</p>
