			<h4>There will be frustration!</h4>
			<p>When you first begin coding, there will be times you're going to get super frustred. But that's good! Nothing feels more satisfying than pushing through and figuring out the issue at hand.</p> 
			<h3>***Plus it makes you feel like a badass hacker from the movies. ;)***</h3>

			<h4>Don't be afraid to step away</h4>
			<p>Sometimes, you're going to push through, and that's great.  But sometimes - SOMETIMES - you're going to need to step away.  Looking at something too long can just lead to more confusion than necessary.  Take a break, have some tea, and come back with fresh eyes.  You'll be suprprised how much it helps!</p>
			
			<h4>Instant Gratification</h4>
			<p>Personally, my favorite part of coding is that you can see the results of your work in real time.  That webpage didn't exist before you made it, and BOOM!  There it is.  That's pretty rad.</p>
