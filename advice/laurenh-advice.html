			<h4>Keep Calm & Carry On!</h4>
			<p>Learning code can be a series of highs and lows. One day, you can feel on top of the world after finally conquering a certain topic or project. The next day, you might feel frustrated and alone when coding isn't going the way you think it should. Just take a deep breath, don't be afraid to ask for help, and remember that this is normal! Everything will eventually click and you'll master the new concepts in no time with practice!</p>
