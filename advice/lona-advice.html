			<h4>Identify Your Interests</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>I wish I had identified my interests earlier. I liked art and being creative but I wasn't aware of the design/development field much, especially for women. It's great to surround yourself with others who are interested in the field to bounce ideas off of each other and stay encouraged.</p>

			<p>Play around with all areas of the field to get a feel for what's out there and what interests you. You might find out you're a better fit for something you weren't aware of.
