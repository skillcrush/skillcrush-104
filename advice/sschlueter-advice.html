			<h4>Pair Program & Practice!</h4>
			<p>One thing I noticed when I first started learning how to code was that I would learn something for a few months, then either stop or move on to something else.<br/>
			I found this was counterproductive because I would try to come back to what I'd learned, and found myself re-learning everything again!<br/>
			I also believe the best thing you can do as a new developer besides daily practice is to partner with a mentor and/or other developers.<br/>
			There are lots of meetup groups that support this, or you can get involved in the developer community (Gitter Chat is a great start!) in your area to meet others and start your own group!</p>
