			<h2>Use Confusion To Your Advantage</h2>
			<p>
			When you begin learning to code, you have to start thinking different. You must learn to think logically, step by step, and imagine "what if?"
			scenarios, all at the same time. You might feel overwhelmed. It's OK, you are going through the same thing as thousands before you have.</p>
			</p>
			Take that confusion, and use it as drive to learn how to successfully research a problem. Google and YouTube will answer every question you can imagine.
			Someone has been in the same place before as you. Coders love to share information and skills. There are plenty of forums loaded with knowledgable people who are happy to help you.
			Just be aware, most of them do not like to spoon feed you, so try to find the answer in websites or videos first. 
			<p>
			One of the best examples of learning from YouTube is Derek Banas's channel. He covers many types of code, and your problem or something like it will 
			probably be covered. If not, you will most likely be able to figure it out after watching. If that doesn't help, Stack Overflow is a great forum style 
			website with nearly every technical topic covered. If you want a reference book, or learn from a book or video, Packt publishing puts out some great material. 
			Better yet, take Skillcrush's basic HTML tutorial. Even if you are attempting to learn some other flavor of code, it will help you develop the right thinking patterns.		
            </p>
			<p>Either way, use a good free editor like Brackets or Sublime Text. They can help you learn with pointing out typographical errors. Just make sure you don't get lazy and
			let them do the work; you're code will be horrible and you will not become a valuable asset to any employer or client.</p>
			<p>
			Lots of luck and don't give up,</br>John Nicholson</p>
