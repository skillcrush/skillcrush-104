			<h4>It's Okay!</h4>
			<p>When I first started programming I felt so lost, I started to pick it up and than things got easy. . .Until I started learning a different coding language. </p>
			<p>I struggled and when I would mess something up I would feel defeated and annoyed that I could figure out what I was doing wrong.</p>
			<p>What I have learned is that the coding community is great, if I have questions it is so easy to get help because there are people out there that love to help. </p>
			<p> So take on some challenges, if you get stuck just ask for help and do some researching! </p>
