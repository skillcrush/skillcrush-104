			<h4>Everything works to the good of those that love the Lord who are the called according to the Lord's purpose</h4>
			<p>What does that mean? Do only those who are called according to the Lord's plan love God and enjoy the resulting eventual complete success?</p>

			<p>God can't be like that.</p>

			<h4>Who are you, but a human, to say how God can and cannot be?</h4>
			<p>If I have no insight into the divine, how can I know which religious ideas to follow and how to interpret them?</p>

			<p>Did the author make a mistake? Or am I mistaken about God? Or am I misunderstanding the author's meaning?</p>

			<p>Oh, see, that one was Paul; by his own admission (1 Corinthians 13), he doesn't always get everything right. Of course, I admit the same of myself. So, huh; impasse I guess.</p>
