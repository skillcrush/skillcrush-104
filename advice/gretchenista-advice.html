	<p>When I first started coding, I was excited about learning a new language and all the happenings behind computer programs and applications. At the same time, I felt somewhat nervous about making mistakes that totally mess up programs.</p>
                
                <p>There were times I was frustrated with coding. I learned that I should not be afraid to ask if I am do not understand the methods or how to code a program with Ruby.</p>
                
                <p>I should also be consistent about learning to code, even if I think I cannot make time. I resolve to learn coding regularly and not be sporadic about when to learn. I will make a point to learn every day, even if it just a little.</p>
                
                <p>Remember, practice, practice, practice! If it becomes difficult, keep trying until the code works. It never hurts to go back and review the methods. In fact, I encourage it because if you don't use it, you lose it.</p>
                
                <p>After all your hard work into making your code work, celebrate. You deserve a cookie (or more or any other favorite treat), hence my site <a href="http://www.cookiesandcoding.com">Cookies and Coding</a>!</p>
