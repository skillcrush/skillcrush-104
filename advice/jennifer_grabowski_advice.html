			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When coding, make sure to have a plan. It is better to spend the time mapping out project, then trying to figure it out as you go. </p>
			<p>When something works, save a copy and then create new copies as you add new features. If it is a small thing just saving a new file will work. Now that I have learned about github.com, you could push up the working code, then keeping going with you new changes locally. That way you know what is on the github respository is the working code version!</p>
