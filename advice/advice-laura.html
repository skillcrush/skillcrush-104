			<h4>Be like Sherlock Holmes!</h4>
			<p>If something isn't working, follow the clues to find out what has gone wrong.  See which bits of your code are working, and use these to locate the errors.</p>

			<h4>Google is your friend.</h4>
			<p>If you can't work out why something isn't working, try googling to see if others have had the same problem, and see what possible solutions might be.  Don't copy and paste error messages in their entirity though, as they're likely to be too specific to be of use.  Instead, pick out the most important elements and google these.</p>
