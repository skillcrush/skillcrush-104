			<h4>Take Your Time</h4>
			<p>With a new lesson everyday, it may be tempting to rush through an assignment just to stay on track. However, it's more important to take your time and really understand the content. Use the weekends to catch up or double up if a lesson seems particularly quick and clear.</p>

			<h4>Use the Google Group</h4>
			<p>It is easy to think that other people are understanding the content better than you are, making you shy away from using the Google Group. In reality, everyone is learning something new! It's suprising how often someone will have already asked a question that you were wondering about yourself.</p>

			<p>One of the best aspects of Skillcrush is the support so don't be afraid to post in the group, talk to your instructor and go to office hours!</p>
