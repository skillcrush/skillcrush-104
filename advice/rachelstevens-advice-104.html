			<h4>Patience With Yourself</h4>
			<p>When you first start learning to code, and things seem really foreign and confusing, the best thing to remember is to be patient with yourself. You are in fact, learning an entire new language! And the details really matter. Getting the details down, like your syntax, keeping your code neat, etc. is very important.</p>
			<p>Give yourself the time you need to absorb the foundational concepts and make sure you develop good habits in following best practices right from the start. Don't worry if you aren't comprehending everything as fast as you think you should. Reach out to others and explore online. Sometimes just having something explained to you a different way will make all the difference to bringing you to your "got it!" moment.</p>
			<p>Maybe you are learning this new skill while trying to juggle a full-time job, family responsibilities, and other commitments. Remember to take care of you, and take a break when you need to...especially when you are struggling with learning new concepts. A re-charged you will help you return to the task with a fresh brain and more energy.</p>
			<p>And last, but not least, the old adage "practice makes perfect" applies, just like learning any new skill. When you start getting something, repeat it and practice it to help it sink in.</p>
