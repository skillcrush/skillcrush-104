			<h4>Google is your best friend</h4>
			<p>You must master the wording of getting the right results from google to get your question answered. Being that is about creating web pages, what would have better resources for solving your problems then the web. </p>

			<h4>If you start to get overwhelmed or confused, take a break.</h4>
			<p>It is okay to take breaks if you don't understand something. There has been plenty of times that I have been ready to throw the towel in on the whole coding thing but instead took a break to clear my head. I went back to the lesson the next day and it all clicked in seconds. And if you still can't figure it out, go to Google hehe.</p>
            
            <h4>Make developer friends</h4>
			<p>I am currently a web designer, so I am lucky I have a couple of developer co-workers to tap into if I get stuck. Keep them close, they can help when you get into a jam.</p>
            
            <h4>There is nothing like the feeling of figuring out a problem by yourself</h4>
			<p>It feels as if you have conquered the world, and you will want to hold on to that feeling. So keep on coding!</p>
