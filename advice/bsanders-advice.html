			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app, you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem-solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see, when you encounter a new programming language, part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
			
			<h4>Punctuation is also your friend.</h4>
			<p>When troubleshooting your code, the first thing to look at is to make sure you've spelled everything correctly and included every comma, semi-colon, and curly brace necessary. Much like I've had to add some punctuation here and there in the pre-written paragraphs above to make the sentences fully make sense, your computer won't understand what you're telling it if you miss even a single character.</p>
			
			<p>Unlike humans who can usually correctly figure out what you meant regardless of how you wrote it, it's all or nothing with a computer. If it has to "guess" at what you want it to do, that's how you wind up with funky formatting like page elements in the wrong places, if not simply the "white screen of death".</p>
