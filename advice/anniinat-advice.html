			<h4>Grit is everything!</h4>
			<p>When it comes to coding, grit is everything! Learning coding can be confusing at first, especially if you don't know what you want to create. In the beginning that is a hard one because you don't even know all the possibilities that exist!</p>

			<p>It all comes together at some point. You have been learning a bit from here and a bit from there and soon realize that you already know more than you thought was possible. You'll also realize the amount of stuff you <i>don't</i> know, which is fine too. Just keep going!</p>

			<h4>Getting over the impostor syndrome</h4>
			<p>Because you know painstakingly well how little you know about code, you sometimes feel like an impostor. How can you own your very own spot in tech if you are new to all things? There's no point in making comparisons to what other coders can or can't do - better way is to think yourself as a bridge to people who know nothing about code!</p>
