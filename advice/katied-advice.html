			<h4>Practice every day.</h4>
			<p>It's crazy how quick you can forget something that you swore you had down pat just yesterday. Practice every day to keep your skills sharp.</p>
			
			<h4>Quench your curiosity.</h4>
			<p>If something confuses you as you're coding, don't just assume you'll figure it out later. Do your due diligence and take it upon yourself to ensure you fully understand everything you encounter.</p>
			
			<h4>Give yourself a break.</h4>
			<p>Coding is hard. If something isn't clicking, take a deep breath, walk away, and just try, try again. Don't beat yourself up and remember that you're a bad-a$$ for taking this on!</p>
			
			<h4>Try to answer your own questions.</h4>
			<p>I often find that just by writing out my own question I am able to better understand how to get to the answer or what I need to Google to figure out myself. While you shouldn't be afraid to ask for help when you need it, coding is all about problem-solving, so get in the mindset of digging deeper on your own before asking for the answer from somebody else.</p>
