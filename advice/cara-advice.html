			<h4>Step away from the computer!</h4>
			<p>Programming for beginners is like looking at a completely new language. It's all gibberish, and it'll probably be gibberish for a while. I've learned to be patient with myself, and take the time to get it right.</p>

			<p>When nothing you do helps, take a deep breath, and Step away from the computer! Go play a round of fetch with your dog. Go take a quick trip to the corner deli. Make yourself a sandwich. Do something else to recharge and come back fresh and clearheaded. See the code with fresh eyes and you'll keep more of your hair.</p>
