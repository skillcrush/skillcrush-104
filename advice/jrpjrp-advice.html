			<h4>Sometimes taking a break gives clarity to a problem.</h4>
			<p>When you are stuck on a problem and can't seem to figure it out no matter what you do, it may help just to stop.  Maybe you need to sleep, take a deep breath, exercise or stretch.  Whatever you can do to give your mind a rest and then return with a fresh perspecitve.</p>

			<h4>Stay hydrated, properly nourished, and rested!</h4>
			<p>Make sure you keep your brain functioning at its best by staying hydrated, well-nourished (avoiding sugary snacks and junk food), and well-rested to perform your best.</p>

			<h4>Be patient with yourself!</h4>

			<p>All things worth doing take time and practice.  Don't expect overnight results.  Give yourself the time it takes to really learn something.  Making mistakes is part of that process so allow it to happen and embrace what you learn!</p>
