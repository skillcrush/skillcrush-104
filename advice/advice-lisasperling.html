			<h2>Focus on your mindset first and foremost</h2>
			<p>Most coding newbies (and oldies) deal with imposter syndrom. In Aristotle's words: "The more you know, the more you know you don't know." That can be overwhelming and scary - especially, if you work alongside experienced developers. Rather than focusing on the things you don't know, remind yourself of all the things you DO know. Remember that you are smart and capable, and that you'll gain more knowledge along the way.</p>

			<h2>Be ready to be a lifelong learner</h2>
			<p>Be curious, keep an open mind - because there will always be more to learn. Make it a daily habit to practice and learn something new, so you don't get stuck in beginner mode, but can advance your career and become an expert at what you do.</p>

			<h2>Surround yourself with fellow developers</h2>

			<p>Learning from other more experienced web developers is a great way to enhance your knowledge. Join a meetup, get a mentor. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Everyone had to start somewhere.</p>
