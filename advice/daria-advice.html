			<h4>Don't let the imposter syndrome take over!</h4>
			<p>When you start learning programming, you will feel like a super human. Suddenly you have access to all this information not viasble to most human beings. However, rememeber that even though the first project might be overwhelming, you've learned a lot. </p>

			<p>Don't compare yourself to other develpers. You might not have the same experience but you do have knowledge to crack the probelms. You will find your way around sooner or later...Just don't give up when things get hard.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
