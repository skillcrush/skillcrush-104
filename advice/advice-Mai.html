			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before and it is scary. As I have continued with my learning,  I now see it as a challenge and a opportunity that not only empowers me but can help people, and  that is exciting.</p>

			<p>Confusion, <span> alot of confusion</span> therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
