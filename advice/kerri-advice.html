			<h4>Celebrate each small success.</h4>
			<p>Learning to code is tough - it is a ton of new information! While you are learning, it is easy to feel dumb - but you are definitely not. Remember to celebrate every single success along the way and to look at how far you have come. Learned what a p tag is? Yay! Learned what a function is? That's awesome! These are all things that you didn't know a little while ago.</p>

			<h4>Always assume the best of people.</h4>
			<p>Assume that others are nice. Assume that they want to help. Assume that they think you are smart and that you know what you are doing.</p>

			<p>This will help you feel more comfortable asking questions and looking for opportunities in this new field, cut down on stress, and of course, will just make the world seem like a <span>brighter and friendlier</span> place.</p>
