			<h4>Coffee's bad, m'kay?</h4>
			<p>I used to drink coffee thinking it helped me concentrate, but after way too long I realized it was just causing me massive anxiety. Trying to push yourself to learn code with a body full of caffeine is really not good if you're feeling super stressed and don't seem to be learning much quickly. I also started taking brain-healthy supplements like fish oil and lion's mane mushroom extract. Overall, it's made a big difference.</p>

			<p>It takes about 2 weeks to get over coffee. I switched to rooibos tea for non-caffeinated energy and when I want that coffee flavor, I drink Cafix, which, to me, tastes like any standard NYC corner deli coffee.</p>

			<h4>Get curious, avoid "big picture" worries</h4>
			<p>Try to look at the big picture and become overwhelmed by it. It's really easy to start thinking negatively when you think about all the different code you have to learn.</p>

			<p>Instead, the best piece of advice I got was to get curious about whatever you're trying to learn. It flipped a switch in my brain quickly and simply. Think of learning code as a game or puzzle or something you're genuinely interested in and approach it every step with curiosity. This is how you naturally learn anything as a kid. If you start to feel overwhelmed or frustrated, that's a sign you've slipped into "big picture worries" again. You need to just pause and take a moment to reorient yourself. Forget about the notion that "you'll never get this stuff!" or whatever other exasperated thoughts you're having. Refocus on only what you are currently looking at and get curious again. Think to yourself, "now how the heck does that work?" or "now why the heck didn't that work?" and just start analyzing what you're doing carefully. If you're curious about guitar, you can learn guitar. If you're curious about code, you can learn code.</p>

			<h4>Experiment a lot</h4>
			<p>Practice makes perfect. You can't really learn from just watching videos. You'll never remember anything. Skillcrush follows the best advice for learning, so it's really cool for people who don't know this material.</p>
