			<h4>NEVER GIVE UP</h4>
			<p>Programming is very daunting at first but don't give in to your doubts. They only hold you back.</p>

			<p>My advice for anyone starting to code and go through this amazing journey is to learn how to enjoy rough patches. There will be times where you feel so lost and your brain will want to melt as you type and re-type. You will sit and look at your computer screen and think "What just happened?". But every little piece of exposure to the language is beneficial in some way. Even if you don't know what's going on. Until one day your brain lights up like fireworks and you can finally wrap your head around a concept. That feeling, till this day is one of the greatest and biggest reasons why I chose coding as my life's passion. So learn to enjoy the rouch patches as it will make you appreciate the smooth parts even more.</p>

			<h4>Don't sweat it if you can't just yet...</h4>
			<p>There will be times where you just won't get it. Where you feel as if you cannot seem to understand what's going on. DO NOT PANICK. YOU'RE NOT DUMB. YOU'RE NOT HOPELESS. Slowly but surely you're brain will pick it up. The more you sweat stuff, the more you prolong your brain of catching what's right in front of you. (and a lot of the times it's right in front of you)</p>

			<p>I commend anyone who takes on the challenge of learning how to code. Make sure to suround yourself with an environment that will support you and your aspirations. Find out what decompresses you and challenge every skill that you have aquired. Sharpen your skills and build your imagination.</p>
