			<h4>Don't worry, be confused!</h4>
			<p>One important thing to keep in mind when you're starting on your coding journey is that confusion is naturalâ€”and inevitable. That means it's important to get comfortable with, well, discomfort. It's all a part of the process. Accepting the lack of comfort just might have you feeling a bit more comfortable with all of the confusion.</p>

			<h4>Get Used to Asking All the Questions</h4>
			<p>One thing I know so far is that it's important to get comfortable with the process of asking questions and seeking answers. Both of these can take different forms. Nothing is really handed neatly to you, so embrace the search.</p>
