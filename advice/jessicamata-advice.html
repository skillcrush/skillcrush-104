			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>

			<p>When you first start programming, the struggle is real. Like really real BUT don't give up!! It gets easier! You must be determined and have self motivation. There is also google and book stores which hold all of the tech references you could ever ask for. If you don't understand something the way one person is telling you, find another person to tell you... until you find the person who puts it into words you understand. This is what has worked for me. If ever you're feeling over it step away for a little while and let your brain rest. Get something to eat! go for a walk! veg out on tv for a little bit! Take a nap! I miss lots of little things when I'm exhausted or tired. I've literally spent over an hour trying to figure out why my code wasn't rendering and it turned out to be a capitalized letter where it shouldn't be. Wow! Or what I like to do is look at web design inspo to keep my eye on the prize.Or google salaries for front end developers and web designers.</p>
