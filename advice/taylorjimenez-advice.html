			<h4>Believe in Yourself</h4>
			<p>The worst thing about coding in my opinion is staring at a blank screen, blinking cursor, not knowing where to start.</p>

			<p>The best advice I could give is to <i>believe in your self </i> - that either you know what you're doing or you can find it with your handy friend, Google. If you can break down what you're trying to do in small enough pieces, you come to learn you have the answers or at least know what to ask. </p>
			
			<p>There is no deathly void. <b> You will be alright. </b> </p>
