			<h4>Patience</h4>

				<p>Don't give up, I haven't gotten through this far and been super frustrated. Just keep going.</p>

			<h4>Do it right, take your time.</h4>

				<p>Pretty self-explanitory. If you get so frustrated you just skip a step or say "I'll learn it later" or "It doesn't look that hard" or whatever, you're only hurting yourself. Do it until you can do it right.</p>
