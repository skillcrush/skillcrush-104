			<h4>Don't give up!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first website, you may run into problems you can't imagine solving. Don't give up. Look for help. Ask for help. A fresh set of eyes can also see the error more clearly.</p>

			<h4>Remember to take care of yourself!</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new subject, give yourself a break! You probably have other responsibilities or children who may not allow you to have the focus you need. Be kind to yourself and remember your why!</p>
