			<h4>Walk Away</h4>
			<p>No I am not saying completely walk away from coding forever. If you find yourself in a state of utter confusion, reach out
			<p>with a post in the forum explaining your dilema and then, walk away. Take some time to get something to eat, sleep or maybe g
			<p>grab an adult beverage. Don't stay away too long, but when yo return with a fresh outlook, everything will make more sense.
