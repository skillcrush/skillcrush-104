			<h3>Failure Is The New Success</h3>
			
			<p> "Fail, Fail Again, Fail Better"...is the latest book from Pema Chödrön, an American Buddhist Nun that has shared advice with the best of advice gurus: From Alice Walker to Oprah Winfrey. When one is in a state of uncertainty and/or loss, this is an important reflective to discover the authentic and better you. Life is always about growing and evolving, but it is rooted in loss or uncertainty. It begins from a place of vulnerability and naked truth. </p>

			<p> Well, it all started when I decided to make a career transition. But that choice was a slow evolving process because of fears that hindered my journey through uncertainty. But, I finally faced the truth that I feared the most. There is no need to feel stuck in something, because you have been in it for so long. Change has no sense of time or involuntary committment. Most importantly, there should not be no stigma or shame in a career transition. In an ever-changing world, trends in labor, economies, and skills are transforming from the conventional norm. </p>

			<p> My advice is not to fear change and uncertainty.  Most importantly, don't get bogged down by the fear of being labeled a "quitter". Finding one's passion and purpose is far from quitting, in fact it's quite the opposite. You are not giving up on your capabilities and self-determination. Never let terms like "quitting", "wasting time", or any other stigmatized label that will suppress your spirit and truthful intentions </p>

			<p> Finally, meditate, take walks, breathe some fresh air, listen to your favorite music, practice the tools of critical thinking...convention is NOT everything. It's refreshing to think out of the box. Also, feel the feels. Don't ignore your feelings of fear, anger, or disappointment. Get through those feelings, understand where they come from, how they evolve, then let it go. Read some cool books from life lesson gurus like Pema Chödrön or whoever you like. </p>
