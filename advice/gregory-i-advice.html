			<h4>Embrace the Unknown</h4>
			<p>There's so much to learn, but don't let it overwhelm you. Take joy in the small victories as the things that were once unknown become understandable to you. And notice how that new knowledge reveals even more things to be leaned â€“ things you didn't even know that you did't know.</p>

			<h4>Avoid Extremes!</h4>
			<p>Everything in moderation, including moderation.</p>

			<p>While good advice in general, it's good to keep in mind when learning something new. You can't learn it if you don't devote some time and effort, but you may burn out if you go all in at 100% effort. Pace yourself.</p>
