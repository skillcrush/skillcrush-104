			<h4>Feeling confused is normal, and should be welcome.</h4>
			<p>You're new at this.
				At some point, something's not going to make sense, or just not work the first time.
				When you're confused about something, it's just another opportunity to learn.
				However, try not to get too bogged down in trying to understand absolutely everything.
				That deeper knowledge will come with time.</p>

			<h4>It's ok to ask for help.</h4>
			<p>You don't have to go it alone. You have classmates and instructors that are here to help you
				whenever something inevitably goes wrong or doesn't make sense.
				While you could probably figure it out on your own, it's so much more efficient to just ask someone else.</p>

			<h4>Stay curious!</h4>
			<p>Always be willing to learn more, explore more, and want more.
				Because learning this stuff can be difficult at times, but it's so much fun!</p>
