			<h4>Think like a programmer!</h4>
			<p>Easier said than done, right? The thing is that programming languages are languages just like any other (i.e. Spanish, English, bad-English, bad-Spanish, grammatically-incorrect-Russian, pig-latin, etc.).  You have to practice it everyday in order to get the hang of it.</p>

			<p>Try to learn some math, if you're not already math inclined.  I am not what you would call terrifyingly mathmatical, but a couple of classes at the community college may not hurt as bad as you might think.</p>

			<h4>Changing the way you think is hard</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, you've got to do this.  Fortunately, the solution is a simple one, and that's practice.</p>

			<p>Read books, too.  Learning someone else's method for doing what they do can only help.  You'll start to incorporate little tid-bits of advice and eventually you'll be programming in your sleep, actually have dreams about programming in your sleep.</p>

			<p>It's can be a long process, but I think you can do it.</p>
