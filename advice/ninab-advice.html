			<h4>Stuggle makes you grow!</h4>
			<p>When you first start to delve into the world of tech, everything seems like a complete struggle!!</p>

			<p>Don't give up when you hit the struggle! Stretching through the struggle is the moment when your brain grows, when you are truly learning something new and you CAN get through it.</p>

			<h4>Mindset</h4>
			<p>I kept being told about "mindset" from my kids schools, but it was only when I started using my brain and discovering unchartered territory that I truely understood what it really means.</p>

			<p>Ultimately, you have to keep an open mind and not give up when the struggle hits. This is called having an open mindset. The belief that you can get something if you keep trying. The concept is not that you don't understand something, its that you don't understand something YET!</p>

			<p>It takes time, it takes patience, but stick with it, don't give up, keep an open mind and believe you can do it, because you can!!!</p>
