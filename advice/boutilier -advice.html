			<h4>Go SLOW!</h4>
				<p>When I started Skillcrush I wanted to zip through everything so I could finish and be a <span>tech wiz</span> asap!</p>

				<p>I quickly learned that this was the wrong mindset!</p>

				<p>Don't skim through anything in your courses because you will definately need that knowledge down the road. </p>

				<p>Everything is important and relates to <span>everything</span> else! </p>

						<ul>
								<li>Go slow! Take your time with each and every task - take no shortcuts.</li>
								<li>Read and re-read everything (a lot of times)!</li>
								<li>Watch and re-watch and re-watch videos!</li>
								<li>Stop when you don't understand something! Don't move on. You will come across the same issue again, guaranteed!</li>
								<li>Use as many resources as you can to help you understand something before moving on.</li>
								<li>Don't be afraid to start something over! It can only help give you a deeper understanding and more practice. </li>
								<li>Stay motivated and always reflect on the tremendous amount of new skills that you've already obtained!</li>
								<li>Never stop learning!</li>
					  </ul>
