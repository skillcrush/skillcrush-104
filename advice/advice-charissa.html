			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>You will be surpised, by YOU!</h4>
			<p>This journey has been the most gratifiying experience of my working career thus far. For me, there is nothing like seeing the pieces come together to create a site, connect a software, or designing a logo. There are a lot of things that say, by the end of this you will be this. But thus far for me skillcrush has been it! I love coding and problem solving that comes with it.</p>

			<h4>The Learning Curve is pretty short.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>Resistance is a sign that you are getting somewhere and learning what you need to know to get to phase. Just keep going, work through the steps and don't give up.</p>
