			<h4>Everything is confusing</h4>
			<p>Everything is REALLY confusing. And, that's okay. I can read the same piece of text 10 times and still not understand it. I own a shelf full of programming books I don't understand. And, that's okay. I will get there someday. And so will you.</p>

			<p>Because everything is so confusing, please do the following: <strong>Make a Backup</strong>. Backup all your projects. Even if something seems totally useless now, if you put more than 3 hours into it, save it. I had to reinstall WordPress many times, on many different sites, because I didn't make a proper backup of my databases or config files.</p>
