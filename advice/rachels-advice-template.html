			<h4>It Takes A Google Group...</h4>
			<p> The Google Group for your class will pove to be invalauable.  While it is true that you can see how others are correcting mistakes, find answers to questions, etc.  The most important thing that this group will do for you is to emphasize that you are not alone.  There are others like you out here jumping into this wild and crazy coding world. </p>

			<h4>Pride Goes Before A Fall....</h4>
			<p>I have a few questions for you. </p>
				<ol>
			<li> Are you new to this?</li>
			<li> Do you already know everything? </li>
			<li>Are you immortal?</li>
		</ol>
			<p> Seems like  a funny question doesn't it especially that last one right?  There is a old adage that says Pride come before a fall.  This basically means that sometimes our EGO can get in the way and even though the class instructors have said it a hundred times...we just can't seem to ask for help</p>

			<p> Here is where being immortal would be a huge plus! But I suspect that you are just an everyday person like me with limited time.  SO the quickest way to get through this is to ASK FOR HELP! I can honestly say that this group has never shamed me or called me stupid or anything negative.  Even when it seemed like I was asking the same questions over and over again. </p>

			<p>Don't fall down it takes a gogle group to "raise you" as a up and coming Developer/Designer.</p>
