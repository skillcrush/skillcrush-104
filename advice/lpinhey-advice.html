			<h4>Two Heads are Better Than One, and the Same Goes for Monitors</h4>
			<p>If you can, use two monitors while working through your Skillcrush Blueprint.
				This will be especially helpful while learning JavaScript and Ruby. It's
				much easier to complete projects when you have the extra screen "real estate"
				to view both your assigment and the Skillcrush lessons, cheatsheets,
				and other resources at once without having to go back and forth between
				browser windows.
