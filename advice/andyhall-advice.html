			<h4>The first 3-month rabbit hole.</h4>
			<p>When you are first learning to code, or deciding to learn to code your first three months will be spent going down the "learning to code" rabbit hole.  What I mean by this is that you aren't actually going to learn to code during that first three months.  You are going to find "ways" of learning to code during that time.  And, you are going to fill up your bookmarks with all of the learning to code resources out there.</p>

			<p>You will flit from website to website and coding language to coding language like a bee in a flower garden.  I wish someone had told me at the beginning to just start with html.  I was actually a beta tester for codecademey.com years ago and my first language I signed up for was ruby with no idea what it even does.</p>

			<h4>My advice to you is find out why you're learning!</h4>
			<p>Do you want to create an app?  A website?  To become a programmer like you've seen on a movie (drinking Rockstars and eating junk food)?  What do you want to do?  And, if you don't know the answer to that, start with html!  Done, no more rabbit hole.</p>
