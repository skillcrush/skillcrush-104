			<h4>College is for the Non-Thinker!</h4>
			<p>If you are looking for a career in technology, more specifically in programming/coding, the internet is the #1 learning resource. College has become a status symbol, a right of passage, rather than an institution of learning.</p>

			<p>Coding/Programming is a skill or trade that is better understood in practice than in theory. Theory should be taught after getting your hands dirty.</p>

			<h4>Problem solving is the key to success!</h4>
			<p>I think of programming as solving small problems which lead to an even bigger solution, to an even bigger problem.</p>

			<p>My point is that coding can be thought of solving a bunch of small problems to solve the greater picture.</p>

			<p>There is a light entry barrier and limitless pinacles to be reached in the world of programming. Passion for learning new technologies is the key to succes.</p>
