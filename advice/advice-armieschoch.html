			<h4>Overwhelming and Excitement!</h4>
			<p>Taking it all in what you have learned and putting it into action is very overwhelming but at the same time very
				exciting; the endless possibilities of what you can create. It's normal, you are doing something that
				you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development,
				something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Overwhelmed and Confused, but keep the excitement. it is a sign that you are heading in the right direction.
				You are now engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to put
				your geek hat on because you know what? before you know it you will be or already one of the geeks in web development
				and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or
				just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking
				at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact,
				it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train
				your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what
				it's doing.</p>
