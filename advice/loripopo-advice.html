			<h4>Reflect and Celebrate</h4>
				<p>Embarking on the journey to code is frustrating. It's probably unlike anything you have done
				before. Allow yourself to get frustrated, but don't forget to celebrate what you have
				accomplished. Take time to reflect on what you have learned. Document the frustrations and the
				subsequent triumphs. You'll be amazed at what you learned!</p>
