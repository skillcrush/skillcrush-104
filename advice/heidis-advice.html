			<h4>Just Keep Swimming</h4>
			<p>I have had to tell myself countless times through this process to just keep going. Perfection is not what is going to teach me to code or make me a better coder. Sitting down and working through things is. When things get hard just keep swimming!</p>

			<h4>You're Worth It</h4>
			<p>You have invested both time and money into learning to code and that is awesome! You are worth it! There is nobody else who is going to code like you and bring your skillsets and experiences to the table in the same way that you will. If you don't have people around you telling you that you're worth it, tell yourself (Actually telling yourself even if you do have people like that is still a good idea.) There is always room for another coder in this world!</p>
