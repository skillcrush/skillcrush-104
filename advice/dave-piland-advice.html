			<h4>Keep Calm and Keep Coding</h4>
			<p>The most important thing to remember is to <strong>remain confident</strong>. You should expect to fail repeatedly and be patient with your progress; because becoming an expert at anything requires hard work and time. And if a single doubt ever clouds your mind, remember that every programmer has walked this path before, none of them more destined to become a developer than you. The only barrier to success is your work ethic and confidence to persevere.</p>
