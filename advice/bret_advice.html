			<h4>Advice On Demand</h4>
			<p><span class="ego">I'm a wealth of good advice, and you're an empty vessel waiting to be filled.</span> Just pick your topic in the advice picker above, and I'll tell you what I think. So what will it be?</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="advice-box hide" id="html">
			<h4>Not so fast, hombre.</h4>
			<p>I know how awesome it feels to code up a page with HTML. But don't let it go to your head: it's a <em>markup</em> languge, remember. It's not real code. Not, like. for <em>real.</em></p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="advice-box hide" id="css">
			<h4>Brute Force</h4>
			<p>Sometimes styles override each other. Okay, this used to happen to me, like, all of the time. And then I learned the rat-fink cheat for CSS in the history thereof: "!important." You just shimmy that little number into your styles and watch everything just do exactly what it's s'posed to do. </p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="advice-box hide" id="javascript">
			<h4>It's not you. It's me.</h4>
			<p>Learning Javascript feels like you're trapped in Taylor Swift's song "Blank Space." It's a rose garden filled with thorns. It's a nightmare dressed like a day dream.  But when your website isn't working, it's not javascript's fault. It's you, dummy. </p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="advice-box hide" id="wordpress">
			<h4>Move along, Sparky</h4>
			<p>So you may have noticed that sites like Fiverr are flooded with Wordpress gurus from Pakistan offering to customize plugins for just $5. Now think: are the kind of clients that show for work on Fiverr looking to pay slave-wages for tech work the kind of client that <em>you</em> are eager to work for? Didn't think so.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="advice-box hide" id="women">
			<h4>Don't Make This Difficult</h4>
			<p>Love 'em or leave 'em, fellas. On second thought, just love them; only a deadbeat leaves his woman.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="advice-box hide" id="men">
			<h4>Multitasking</h4>
			<p>Ladies, if you're with a guy who is fine with you learning tech skills, just so long as you learn them barefoot in the kitchen, you might be with the wrong guy. Just sayin'</p>
            </div>
             
             <div class="advice-box hide" id="olivia">
			<h4>Good News/Bad News</h4>
			<p>Well, Olivia is taken. BUT, a look like hers can be found from time to time.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="advice-box hide" id="meaning">
			<h4>Good reads.</h4>
			<p>Read the Bible one time, cover to cover, as fast as you can. It will probably take 2 or 3 months. But it's worth it.</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="advice-box hide" id="food">
			<h4>Rules and Exceptions</h4>
			<p>I think eveyone should try foods from as many cultures as possible. I <em>used</em> to belive that every culture had a brilliant dish, just waiting to be experienced. Then I had Ethiopian food, which was a lot of stewed dishes that you eat with your hands. So, if you're new to exotic cuisine, don't start with Ethiopian. Start with Thai. Thai food is <em>really</em> good. </p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="advice-box hide" id="olivia">
			<h4>Tape it like its 1984</h4>
			<p>I hate to be a fan-boy, but Apple Music over Spotify. They just get me, you know?</p>
            </div>
        
            <div class="advice-box hide" id="olivia">
			<h4>You're Fired</h4>
			<p>I've given this some thought, but I think I'd vote for Arnold Schwarzenegger for POTUS. I know he's ineligible, but these days it seems like the notion of eligibility is particularly fungible. Plus, we already know what the campaign slogan for his re-election would be. You can't unsee it. </p>
