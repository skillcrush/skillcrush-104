			<h4>Don't doubt your abilities because of mistakes, even if there are many!</h4>
            <p>Most often, mistakes are easily fixed and are not the end of the world. When I was learning responsive design I had many errors and it took me longer than expected to finish. I began to think that this was not for me and that I may not ever finish! Once I got through the parts that were difficult, it started coming really quick for me and finally clicked!</p>

			<h4>Give it time and be patient.</h4>
			<p>It takes a lot of time to learn, and some things will come quick and easy. Other things may take a little while! Take your time and check through your work carefully and reread or rewatch videos to make sure you didn't miss anything.</p>
