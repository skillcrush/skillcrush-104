			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
			<br>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
			<br>

			<h4>Never, ever give up.</h4>
			<p>Yes, it's daunting and overwhelming, and you may feel like you'll never fully understand. Trust me. I've thought to myself countless times, "Will I ever succeed? Will I ever get this?" And you will! It will take time, dedication, hours of effort, and even the support of your loved ones. But you will. So never stop being curious and always ask questions. There are numerous sources out there to help you</p>
			<br>

			<h4>The Sky is the Limit</h4>
			<p>Have you heard this phrase before? When I first heard this phrase from my brother-in-law, I was like "wow". Because the sky really is the limit! My last piece of advice to you all is to never limit yourself to one answer. There may be good answer or even a best answer, but there is never just one answer. So always remember that this world is filled with endless possibilities.</p>
