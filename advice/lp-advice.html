			<h4>Keep going!</h4>
			<p>My advice is to keep going through the hard parts, the confusing parts, the frustrating parts, the very very lost parts.</p>

			<p>It may like a good idea to stick with one problem until it's solved, but then nothing else will get done. </p>

			<p>If you can move forward and leave a problem to return to, then do that, and keep going! </p>

			<p>Sometimes a solution will become more apparent as you move through other challenges.</p>
