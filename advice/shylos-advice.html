			<h4>Fail, fail often, fail fast, fail hard, learn, then try something new...</h4>
			<p>This is my motto...now. I used to be a perfectionist, until it burned me out and gave me gallstones, ulcers, and severe anxiety. I got so angry when I couldn't figure things out. I felt like I should always have the answers for some reason. Over the last seven years I've progressively relinquished my need for control and perfection. It's a work in progress, and probably always will be. During that time I've done a lot of amazing things and met a lot of amazing people through conferences, jams, hackathons, and meetups for game development, and nothing about it was meant to be perfect. In fact, the more problems we found the faster we learned.</p>

			<p>Jams and hackathons are my favorite. When I first started to do them I would get so tied up in trying to make the next amazing hit that everyone would talk about on social media. I would panic the last day scrambling to make it perfect. My team, if I even had one, would look at me like I was insane. They usually had more experience then me and knew all along we wouldn't finish the way we had talked about in the beginning, so they weren't disappointed. Instead they kept plugging along trying to solve their part of the problem with a smile, drinking an energy drink, and cheering when they found answers. I would instead treat answers I found like they were supposed to happen and only gave myself negative feedback for failure. The more I participated in jams and hackathons however, the more I learned. I realized in 48 hours, one jam could teach me more than a month of tutorials. I failed fast, got up tried something else, got some good feedback and started to cheer myself on. I realized that the product wasn't the quest for me anymore, it's the process. The product is for someone else. But what I get out of it is learning, experience, and the joy of solving a problem. I learned from those zen like developers and figured out why they smiled while they failed. Because failing means they're getting what they're looking for, experience and new knowledge. That is the reward...I just didn't know it.</p>

			<h4>We are always a work in progress</h4>
			<p>You will never be perfect, so get that out of your head now. There's no such thing. If you're lucky though, you'll always be a work in progress as long as you keep learning. And to learn you have to fail and then get back up and try again. It's simple logic ;-)</p>

			<p>Don't give up or that work in progress will become a work in stagnation, and then a work in degradation. You'll forget it all. Keep plugging away, do jams and hackathons, and learn more every day. Not once a week. Every day. You'll thank me for it.</p>

			<p>Last but not least, participate in the community. The Skillcrush community, your local community, clubs, groups, cons, jams and hackathons, whatever...just meet people like you and talk about this stuff. It'll energize you like nothing else, and you learn so much more from more than one brain.</p>
