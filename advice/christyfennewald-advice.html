			<h4>Practice makes...progress</h4>
			<p>The saying "practice makes perfect" is never true in this industry. Rather, practice does make progress. Avoid sitting and watching. Instead, practice as you learn. With practice, you'll make progress.</p>

			<p>With practice, you can develop the right questions to ask.</p>

			<h4>Start freelancing early</h4>
			<p>Even if it is is only for pretend, make up clients early in your journey. The more projects you complete, the more progress you'll make and the more you'll have for your portfolio.</p>

			<p>Plus, if you find a "for real" client, you can even make some money to offset the costs of your learning!</p>

			<p>The best part, you'll develop skills that matter to you.</p>
