			<h3>Don't Fear Doubt!</h3>
			<p>As you start any new path in life, such as your journey into programming, there will be moments of doubt. However, these moments are not to be feared, be bold & trust in yourself to be able to expand your horizon and learn a new skill.</p>

			<p>And when, or if, you feel lost along the way, don't try to figure everything out on your own, because you are not alone in this journey. Reach out to others and ask for help.</p>

			<h3>Work Hard, but don't be too hard on yourself.</h3>
			<p>Consistency is a vital part of any learning process, and programming is no different. Make sure you are always working on your new skills, even if time is limited, you are tired, or life keeps getting in the way of your new path.</p>
			<p>Don't allow yourself to be intimidated by age, education, or someone's apparent handle on a subject. Although we are all on this journey together, each is in different parts of it and bringing along different baggage.</p>

			<p>Remember that you should be doing this for yourself, so make time.</p>

			<p>Keep working hard, make time to practice every new skill and review previous ones.</p>
			<p>Be brave. Be bold. Be yourself.</p>
			<p>And at the end of the day give yourself credit for all your work, regardless of where you are on the journey.</p>
