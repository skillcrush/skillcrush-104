			<h4>Patience is key</h4>
			<p>Coding takes an immense amount of patience. Cultivating the patience to comb through lines of code to find that one forgotten bracket, open tag or misspelled class or id to make your front-facing design sparkle and shine is critical to success.</p>

			<h4>But remember, you're not in it alone.</h4>
			<p>The coding community is huge and friendly and there are an immense amount of resources available to help you break down any blocks or challenges you're facing. Don't be afraid to ask for help, poke around the Internets and beg, borrow and steal code that you admire for your own project. Just remember to share and share alike.</p>
