			<h4>Devtools is your friend!</h4>
			<p>Learning to use devtools has completely changed how I solve coding conflicts</p>

			<p>Once I finally figured out all of the ins and outs of devtools it greatly reduced the time it takes to fix issues</p>

			<h4>It reveals secrets</h4>
			<p>Devtools shows you all of the pesky preset browser styles that may conflict with your own styles.</p>

			<p>It also allows you to see what code might be conflicting with another by crossing out styles that aren't able to apply &amp; It tells you where each syle is coming from.</p>

			<p>I highly suggest learning dev tools!</p>
