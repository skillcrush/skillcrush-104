		<h4>Don't try moving across the country while taking this course!</h4>
		<p>So, I would recommend NOT interviewing for a new job located all the way across the country from where you are currently located, accepting the job, planning an immediate move across the country and then actually MOVING, all while taking this course.</p>
		<p>You need to focus on only one thing at at time, and doing both of these things simultaneously will drive you insane.  Or.... at least it is for me.</p>
