			<h4>Just Keep Going</h4>
			<p>Perhaps the last time that you learned a new language was upon your entry into this world - meaning, your very first language.  Learning coding languages is somewhat similar to that experience. Considering that many of us don't make a practice of learning languages throughout our years, that feeling of confusion as you learn to build "sentences" and "paragraphs" is foreign and almost forgotten.  But - Just Keep Going - you will be fluent in no time.</p>
