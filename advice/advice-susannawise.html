			<h4>Just Keep Swimming!</h4>
			<p>It takes a lot of time to really start to understand what you are doing.</p>

			<p>The best way to get to understanding, is to just keep doing it. The more you do something, the more you begin to understand exactly what you're doing.</p>

			<h4>Go Easy On Yourself & the Word YET is Your Best Friend</h4>
			<p>It is easy to feel like you are stupid when you are struggling to understand something.</p>

			<p>If you get down on yourself and let yourself think that you actually are stupid and can't learn this, then it will be a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

			<p>So, instead of thinking "I'm stupid. I don't get this." Think, "I don't get this YET". That means you believe you WILL get it eventually. And if you believe that you will get it, then that will become your self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
