			<h4><strong>Confusion</strong><br> is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that<strong> you have never done before.</strong> </p><p>It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p><strong>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction.</strong></p><p> It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="advice2">
			<h4><strong>Suspended disbelief</strong><br> plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this <strong>uncomfortable phase</strong> where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but <strong>you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening!</strong></p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and <strong>in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</strong></p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. <strong>The way to train your eye</strong> is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
