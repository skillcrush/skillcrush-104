			<h4>Google is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you first start programming you are doing something that you have never done before. There are way more things to learn than you can know right off the bat! So be ready to move those fingers and read as many forums and online resources as you can imagine!</p>

			<p>Google really will save your bacon when you're trying to figure out a problem you've encountered.</p>

			<h4>Find some real life nerd friends.</h4>
			<p>When learning a new skill, its important to have some fun with it. It's also important to find yourself a support group where you can find encouragment and inspiration.</p>

			<p>So strike out! Find your village!</p>

			<p>You'll find that having a group of friends to help you learn or cheer you on can really make all the difference.</p>
