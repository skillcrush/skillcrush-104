			<h2>Dont' Get Bogged Down in Why!</h2>
			<p>There’s a certain level of trust involved when you starting out learning web development.  Certain assumptions you have to be willing and flexible enough to accept, maybe even before you fully understand them in order to eventually see the bigger picture.  It’s not unlike learning music in a way.  When you first start out and someone tells you that you are to learn a scale and that the scale has notes that go CDEFGAB and then repeat.  You just have to sort of take it on faith.  "Well, why does it start on C and why is this particular note named that and why doesn’t it just go up and up and up the whole alphabet," you say? </p>

			<p>This is where it your trust and willingness to accept some uncertainty will allow you to learn such difficult things.  At some point you will see connections and have a bigger understanding, but it doesn’t help you learn to play if you get bogged down trying to figure all this out right away. </p>

			<h4>Learning new things often requires some blind faith that things will eventually make sense</h4>
			<p>This is why it’s invaluable to have good instructors and guides to lead you step by step far enough and long enough that at some point you’ll have a bigger understanding yourself and be better equipped to figure things out on your own.  But, it also helps to be a good student and be willing to be uncertain and just keeping inching forward with new information even if at some points it’s not perfectly clear how it all fits together.</p>
