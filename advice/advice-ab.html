			<h4>Plan your code before writing</h4>
			<p>Before beginning to code write a document with what are the requirements?  How you will implement them?  Writing code will become much more clear when you have a reference.</p>

			<h4>Read a lot of code</h4>
			<p>It will give you ideas and efficient ways to implement your code.</p>

			<h4>Write simple apps</h4>
			<p>It can be overwhelming to see complex projects but you can start writing very basic apps and build on that by adding more complex features.</p>
