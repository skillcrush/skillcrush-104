			<h4>Expect Confusion!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you
				have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity to learn &amp;
				grow. Take advantage of resources, the web, google, books, friends &amp; fellow
				students. They've been there too, so don't dispair, the solution exists, if you
				invest the time &amp; put your heart into it, it will get easier &amp; more
				enjoyable, come more naturally, &amp; become more rewarding.</p>

			<p>Confusion should be expected therefore, but you shouldn't allow it to discourage
				you. Stay positive, it's a learning experience, it's a new language, think of it
				as a language. Like learning a new language, it will take time &amp; practice, but
				it will come to you. It will start to come more natually. Not sure where to start?
				Try to break down the problem into smaller pieces, then take on one piece at a time.
				Smaller parts are easier to break down &amp; solve.
			</p>

			<h4>Expect some successes!</h4>
			<p>Take joy in you're successes, even the little ones! It will encourage you &amp;
				help motivate you to dig into the next problem. Keep reading the code, practice,
				practice, practice coding, it's worth the effort. There will always be new problems
			  to solve, but as you gain familiarity with the basics, you'll learn how to break the
			  problem apart to work on the pieces.
			</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language you'll find that they have
				many similarities. The syntax may have differences, but the basic pieces are the same.
				So dig in and practice with one, and the next one will be easier.
