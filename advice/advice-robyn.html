			<h4>Committment and Trust</h4>
			<p>Set a daily time commitment for your work.  Stop and start at the designated times, no matter how far you've progressed.  Trust that you will easily pick things up where you left off and make it thru your assignment.</p>

			<p>It can be hard to believe in your own ability to figure things out.  But just as those before you have done, so will you.</p>

			<h4>Use the Skillcrush Community</h4>
			<p>Decide what feels like an appropriate amount of time to work through a problem on your own.  Then ask for help once you've reached that cap.  This is how real developers work too!</p>

			<p>Struggling on your own for too long only wears you out.</p>
