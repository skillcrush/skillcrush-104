			<h4>Believe you can do this</h4>
			<p>The worst thing you can do is doubt your abilities when it gets tough. You've made it this far and you've hit a wall.</p>

			<p>Well, walls are objects. So are ropes and ladders and even helicopters. They just need to be created so you can get over that wall. So create that rope or ladder. And when in doubt find someone with a helicopter. So what if you used their code? You're filing away a treasure of knowledge for the next time. Or maybe, you're filing it away to help someone else one day.</p>

			<h4>You don't have to eat the whole elephant</h4>
			<p>Every great program started as a small bit of code. It turned into thousands and thousands of lines over months and years. It took many tries and many failures before it became Twitter or Facebook. And even now those polished products are shrunk, rewritten and expanded.</p>

			<p>So don't try and build Facebook in a day. Start with just a user profile or a login protocol. Before you know it, you'll be giving Zuck a run for his money.</p>
