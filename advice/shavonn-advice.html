			<h4>Think About It- No, Seriously</h4>
			<p>When you don't understand the concept being explained to you, think about it for a while. Step away, address it again. if you still do not get the concept, yes, you may ask but you can also Google. There are visual aids and less technical all about the internet and some people need that boost of understanding.</p>

			<h4>Talk to Developers</h4>
			<p>If you know a dev, get some chat time in. Discuss code, practices, etc. Don't necessarily turn it into a Q&A as that's not the most fun for them (and that's what you have your wonderful Skillcrush instructors for!) but a real discussion. Gather that experienced logic and understanding. It will cue a spark that will re-enforce everything you're learning.</p>

			<h4>If you like it, great! But if not, that's fine too!</h4>
			<p>There's a lot of pressure being placed on jobs in tech and coding but if you don't feel it is right for you, that's okay. If you love it, keep at it. Stay with it. CODE FOREVER!! :)</p>
