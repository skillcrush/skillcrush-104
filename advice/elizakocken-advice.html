			<h4>Don't be afraid to make mistakes!</h4>
			<p>When you first start out, and probably from then on, coding is hard. The smallest things can make you break your code. But the good news is that you get used to this and you start to look for the small things. You start to tune in to the code and realize why that space mattered or why that tiny typo made that huge difference. So don't be afraid to make a mistake. It's how you learn.</p>
			<p>Because when you make a mistake in code, eventually you will <strong>have</strong> to find it, or else your code won't work.</p>

			<h4>Give yourself a breather when it's all going to hell</h4>
			<p>When you are really stuck and you just can't find out what you are doing wrong, or maybe you know the exact problem but just can't figure out how to get it to do what you want, take a break. Very often, if you are in something for a long time and you can't figure it out, you stop thinking rationally about it and fail to see the solution. Move onto something else for a while. Give your brain a bit of time to relax, and then get back to it. A fresh perspective is always more effective.</p>

			<h4>Question everything, even if you think you sound dumb</h4>
			<p>When you are starting to learn you might have the tendency to copy the code or just follow the instructions, without thinking or asking questions. You should never be ashamed to ask a question, whether that is to other developers or to Google. Think about it, if you start out your coding journey by questioning every piece of code you learn, you will end up with a much better understanding of what that code does. And that will help you in the long run.</p>
