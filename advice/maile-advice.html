			<h4>Pregnancy Brain is a Bitch</h4>
			<p>It's really not the right time to start any lesson when you're pregnant. Especially during your last semester. You forget everything you just learned and wrote down the day before. You get sick most days and end up using up your weekends and precious evenings after our todller has gone to bed to make up for the classes you've missed. And then you're so tired and exahusted, you just go through the motions of finishing up everything and end up forgetting more.</p>
			<p>My only advice, if you want to still sign up in your present occupied condition, is to write profuse notes on everything and anything to help with the "ring a bell" thing in your mind as you go on. And also, don't expect much. You're alreay doing enough as it is. Learning code plus growing a baby definitely earns you a guaranteed spot in heaven despite your nasty foul mood all the time.</p>
