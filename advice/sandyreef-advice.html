			<h4>Start with small steps.</h4>
			<p>When you start learning programming, my suggestion would be to learn something new everyday but not too much at one time, otherwise it will be too overwhelming</p>

			<h4>Learn first the basics.</h4>
			<p>Start your programming career with learning the very basic HTML and CSS. When you can code a website with these tools you can continue to learn other programming languages.</p>
