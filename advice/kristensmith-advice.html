			<h4>One Step at a Time!</h4>
			<p>When you first start out coding, things might seem a little confusing. Loops, if statements, while statements???? What can this all mean? But just take a step back and look at it all logically. Often times, taking a step back and looking at things step by step is the easiest way to go through it.  I'm a firm believer that anyone with access to a computer and good determination can learn to code!</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.  Remember, one step at a time!</p>

			<h4>A Helping Hand.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, you are bound to be stuck, frustrated, and just plain mad! Don't give up! There are tons of resources out there to help you along the way.</p>

			<p>The internet (okay, Google) can often be your best friend.  Also don't be afraid to go out and look for someone further along in their career path as a mentor.  Many times, the main website for the software/program you are in will have a help section that can fix you right up.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.  I often find that listening to coding podcasts give me lots of information and tips as well!</p>
