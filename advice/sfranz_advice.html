			<h4>Do lots of small projects!</h4>
			<p>Once you start feeling comfortable with a programming language, practice using them by doing some small projects. They don't have to turn out perfectly, but playing around in a programming language is one of the best ways to feel comfortable with it and to learn what it can do.</p>

			<p>There are lots of good resources online for examples of small projects (like JavaScript 30) that you can do in a couple of hours each day. It is also a good idea to create the same project using different frameworks, just so you're familiar with the frameworks available.</p>

			<h4>Never stop learning.</h4>
			<p>Spend time each day learning something new about web development or programming, whether that's reading articles on new design ideas or keeping up with leaders in the industry on Twitter. I subscribe to various newsletters, and I try to spend about an hour every evening just catching up on these so I'm aware of the latest trends.</p>

			<p>There's also so many programming languages and frameworks that you can't possibly learn them all. Instead of feeling overwhelmed, use this as an opportunity to always challenge yourself.</p>
