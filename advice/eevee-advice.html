			<h4>Advice I wish I'd gotten!</h4>
			<p>Some things will make sense while you are learning them but get all out of whack when you actually try to implement them.  You may think you are logical but you will quickly begin to question this belief!  I think that's normal.</p>

			<p>Some things will go more smoothly, but then just when you think you are getting somewhere you hit a roadblock.  Don't give in to the frustration!</p>

			<h4>Keep reminding yourself to suspend disbelief.</h4>
			<p>There is nothing quite like the feeling when things come together and work as they should.  This should keep you going, since it is usually some small, minor thing keeping you from success. </p>

			<p>Get up and walk around, take a break and then come back to your computer.  It will give you fresh perspective.</p>

			<p>Remember, if this was easy, everyone would know how to do it.  Don't get discouraged! </p>
