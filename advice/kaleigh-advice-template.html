			<h4>Don't let one section stress you!</h4>
			<p>When I started out, I was sooo frustrated with Adobe Creative Suite
			that I almost gave up on the entire class. I truly did not and still do not enjoy working in
		photoshop, but it is just one small part of this journey! Do not let one small sections deter you
	from your end goals!</p>
	<h4> Comment, comment, comment!</h4>
	<p> Overcomment your code!! you will thank yourself later. Even if the comments seem silly, they
		help so much!</p>
