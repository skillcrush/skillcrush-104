			<h4>Confusion and Frustation are your friend !</h4>
			<p>Whenever you start something new, when it comes to us easy we'll take it for granted! Always! When you put your blood, sweat, giving up going up with friends, sleep, and eating, it's yours forever.</p>

			<p>Life will always throw curve balls! Never give up on yourself, your purpose, and your dreams. Relying on someone else or something else to take care of you, just won't work.</p>
			
			<h4>Always see and know there's a light at the end of the tunnel</h4>
			<p> The above is sooo true!</p>

			<h4>Tackling code</h4>

			<p>When learning a new code language, it's best to break it into parts. Also don't forget to reward yourself EVERYtime you complete a new section. You deserve it!!</p>
