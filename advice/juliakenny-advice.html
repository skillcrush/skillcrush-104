		<h1>Hi, my name is Julia.<br>
			I have some <span>advice</span> for you.</h1>
	</header>

		<div class="advice">
			<h4>Know thyself!</h4>
			<p>What are your personal strengths? Are you happier when creating than when consuming? <span>Of course you are!</span> Are you exceptionally organized - to the point where you may drive others crazy? <span>Yes!</span> Have you always inwardly cringed at the sight of Comic Sans? <span>Haven't we all?</span> Know these qualities &amp; own them proudly! They'll serve you well in the tech field. And knowing them in advance may just be the encouragement you need when you find yourself in a particularly challenging situation! Write these down. Post them in a place you can see them. Remind yourself regularly <span>how wonderful you are</span> and why you're just the person for this job.</p>

			<h4>Just start typing!</h4>
			<p>So you have a complex design in front of you and you don't know where on earth to start? Just <span>start with what you know</span>. Add some content! Having something - anything - in place will give you that <span>momentum</span> you need to start tackling more challenging elements. Look at you go!</p>

			<h4>Phone a friend!</h4>
			<p>Feeling a little like you're drowning? Got a problem you just can't seem to fix? Just looking for a pat on the back for your <span>sick new design</span>? You're in the perfect position to collaborate. And you're probably in good company, too! Your fellow developers are not scary people - <span>they value you as a creative</span> and are more than happy to help! Reach out to them. No, really... <span>Go, do it now!</span></p>
