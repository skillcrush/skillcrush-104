<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
<p>When you start programming, you are doing something you have never done before. This is a new challenge, new opportunity, and something that's most likely never been done before.</p>

<p>If you are confused while you are coding, don't get discouraged! It actually is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. When you are confused, it has started a problem solving pursuit that combines math and technology. This just means that you need to keep looking and keep working to make things clear.</p>

<p>When I got confused, I always read my code over to focus on what I was able to understand. Once I review my code, I use that information to fill in the pieces and figure out what I don't know. If I am still unable to understand what I'm learning, I will try searching for information about areas I don't understand.</p>

<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>

<p>When you are learning anything new, you often go through an uncomfortable phase where you simply look at your code and don't understand what is happening with all the commands you are putting in. We have all been there. This is a normal part of the learning process and actually is one of the most important parts to the entire process.</p>

<p>As you work with a new programming language, you are training your eye to read and understand code. The way you train your eye to read code doesn't happen right away. You'll often feel silly for trying to read code when you don't understand what it's doing. However you will get better as you keep working with code and reading it.</p>

<p>The key to learning how to code is practice. Learning to code is exactly like learning to play an instrument or a sport. The more you practice, the better you will get at reading and understanding code. You can practice by building sites and apps for scratch. I like to open new files and rebuild projects I done from scratch to see what I can do as well as areas I need to review.</p>

<h4>Get involved in your tech community now!</h4>

<p>Learning how to code is a collaborative process. Developers want to help each other and make our lives easier. Let them do it! </p>

<p>There is constantly new information and ideas happening throughout the tech community. Sign up for newsletter and follow tech blogs. Join a forum and chat with other developers. The best way to learn tech is from others already holding tech jobs!</p>
