				<li> Have a vision that motivates you of why you are learning code, it will encourage you to put in the hard hours in the present.</li>
				<li> Dont be afraid of taking risks in order to expand your knowledge , get your feet wet and develope self initiative, it will make you a better problem solver.</li>
