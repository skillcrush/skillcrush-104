			<h4>Check the Little Things First!</h4>
			<p>At first, when something wwent wrong, I assumed something major had happened. I would start searching the web for an answer to what I thought was a complicated problem. However, it usually turned out I had forgotten to close a bracket or something simple like that. Had I checked the simple things first, I could have saved myself a lot of time and stress.</p>

			<h4>Practice Makes Perfect!</h4>
            <p>The best way to learn is to do it! Practicing what you are reading about will help you learn the subject matter better. When you actually do it, you will realize what you actually do understand and don't understand. It will help you know what you need to learn more about.</p>
