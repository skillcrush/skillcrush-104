        <h3>My favorites were&#58;</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="heatherh-advice.html">Heather's</a> link to the <a href="https://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard">Viking Code School Blog</a>.<br>
                    <span>The blog's explanation of why coding is hard and their advice to beginners was a very informative and thought-provoking article.</span></li>

                <li><a href="deblevy-advice.html">Deb's father's advice</a> to her definitely made me laugh.<br>
                        <span>I will have to remember it.</span></li>

        <h3>Maybe I do have some advice...</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't be too hard on yourself if you have to set learning  aside for a while because life or work gets in the way.</li>

			     <li>Just remember why you started, and keep coming back.</li>

			     <li>If you keep chipping away at it, eventually you <strong>will</strong> learn something.</li>
