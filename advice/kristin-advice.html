			<h4>Practice, Practice, Practice!</h4>
			<p>No matter how well you understand the lesson content, you need to put that knowledge into practice.</p>
			<p>A sense of satisfaction grips the mind once you’ve finished learning something new that you fully understand.  Or do you?</p>
			<p>It turns out, there are answers you don’t realize are missing because the questions were never asked.  And you don’t know what is missing if you don’t know what to ask, true?</p>
			<p>So practice what you learn! Create something new. Apply the method.  Figure out what gaps are in your education and fill them.  The more practice you implement the more full your knowledge will be.</p>
