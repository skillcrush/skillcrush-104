			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>I earnestly have no advice to give you, I am still so completely new at this that, while I'm having the time of my life, I still am not at the height of being able to explain half of the processes we go thru clearly.</p>

			<p>However, that doesn't at all mean that I'm going to slow up any time soon, nor while I become complacent again in my beliief in my ability.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p> The above quote about suspending disbelief is a great line, I'm keeping it.</p>

			<p>"This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process." By the God's I hope so.</p>

			<p> I don't feel ready for the upcomming tasks, but that isn't going to stop them from comming, so may as well buck up and dive in.</p>
