			<h4>You're never to old to learn to code</h4>
			<blockquote>When we say that we are too old to learn something, what weâ€™re really saying is that there are certain ages where it is appropriate to learn new things, and ages when it is not.<cite>~ Adda Birnir</cite></blockquote>

			<p>When you think of it like this, the whole question "Am I too old to learn to code?" actually doesn't make a lot of sense. Its always appropriate to learn new skills. That's what makes life sparkle, right?</p>

			<p>Sure, learning to code as an old person can feel really difficult. We get used to feeling reasonably competent in most areas of our life - its hard to embrace that feeling of being a complete beginner at something.</p>

			<p>But stick at it - you won't be a beginner for ever. And those moments you have when you suddenly notice that you actually know some stuff, and get a glimpse of how far you've progressed ... they're gold!</p>
			<h4>Practice makes perfect (or at least really, really good!)</h4>
			<p>Making time to code every day is so important! Because our brains need time & repetition to build new connections you need to use & review the concepts and ideas that you have covered in your learning. Its well worth it to sit down and practice what you are learning in whatever time you have available - even if its just 10 minutes!</p>
			<h4>You learn more by helping others ...</h4>
			<p>Most of us only head to the forums when we get stuck with a problem we can't solve on our own.  But you know what? Helping other people is a great way to cement your own learning - and even if you've only been learning to code for a week, you probably know something that can help someone who has only just started out today.</p>
