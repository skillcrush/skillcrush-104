			<h4>You're going to <span id="fail">fail</span> (HEAR ME OUT)!</h4>
			<p>This is one of those things to which <span class="highlight">NO ONE</span> is going to listen, but it's the truth! .... In a sense... When you first learn to code, you're going to be thrust into this wide world of new content and knowledge! At times, it's going to be too much or maybe even not enough and you're going to do something <span class="highlight">WRONG</span>! This is <span class="highlight">NORMAL</span>! The point is, you have to keep trying! You have to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and get back in there, Tiger! No one else is going to make this journey for you, so if you want it, don't let the bumps knock you off course... <span class="highlight">USE THEM</span> and <span class="highlight">LEARN</span> from them to get you to the right destination the correct way.</p>
