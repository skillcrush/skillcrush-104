			<h4>Do It Anyway ...</h4>
			<p>In high school, HTML was my favorite class.  In fact, my freshman year of college, I was a CompSci major.  I enjoyed coding, but -- at the time -- it did seem applicable in the real-world and I moved into the social sciences.  I found my way back to tech several years after graduating college, as a project and later a product manager.  But I hadn't attempted to really learn more coding.</p>

			<p>I have spent YEARS <span style="text-decoration:underline; font-weight:bold;">not</span> learning to code ... with all the excuses in the book:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>"It's hard."</li>
					<li>"I don't have time."</li>
					<li>"I don't know how to get started."</li>
					<li>"I need a degree in CompSci to code."</li>
					<li>"I work with developers, so I don't need to learn."</li>
					<li>"Coding is boring." </li>
				</ul>
			
			<p>Now that I've started up learning, I'm realizing, what was I waiting for???  I love this!  It's already helping my career.  The community around me is so helpful and collaborative.  Why did I hold out for so long?</p>

			<p>So, my advice to you is to let go of the excuses.  Let go of the limiting thoughts holding you back.  Let go and just put one foot in front of the other.  No excuses.  Just tell yourself, do it anyway.  You think you won't be any good?  Do it anyway.  You think it's too hard?  Show up and do it anyway.  You aren't sure you have the time?  I'm a mother of a toddler.  I work full-time.  And I'm helping my friend cod her app.  All while doing Skillcrush.  Do it anyway.  If learning code is something that you want to do, I promise you that you will get better and you'll thank yourself for showing up and doing it!</p>
