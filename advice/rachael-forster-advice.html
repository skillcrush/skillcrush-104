			<h4>Take a break, but never stop!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and it can be scary to face the unknown.</p>

			<p>Pushing that fear aside and diving in is the best way to learn. That doesn't mean every concept will come easy, in fact, most of them you won't succeed at the first time. But don't let the fear of failure keep you from pushing forward until you make a break through.</p>

			<h4>Sometimes you need to step back.</h4>
			<p>Have you been staring at the same code for more than an hour? There's something wrong but you have no idea what it is? Step away from your computer. Grab a glass of water. Check instagram for a hot second. Maybe take a quick bike ride around the block. </p>

			<p>Clear your mind of the issue for just a brief period and then revisit it shortly after.</p>

			<p>A fresh perspective might be exactly what you need to solve the problem. If you still don't get it right away, that's ok. Hard work and persistency are key to being a coder. But don't be afraid to take a break when you need to. </p>
