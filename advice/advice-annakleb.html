			<h4>Learn to embrace the unknown.</h4>
			<p>My first piece of advice to anyone learning to code is to just pick a language and start. I spent countless hours just searching the internet, pondering what to do instead of actually DOING something. Programming languages all work in similar ways, so once you've got one down, the only differences are syntax. I've dabbled in Javascript, Ruby, PHP, and Python, and once I started learning the fundamentals, I realized how similar they are.</p>

			<p>It's okay to be confused as hell the whole time. I am. But when I look back on where I was when I started my self-taught journey a few months ago, I realize just how much I've learned. This field is a constant learning experience, so you will likely never feel satisfied or, on the other hand, complacent. This is a good thing. Push yourself every day, but don't forget to pat yourself on the back every once in a while.</p>
