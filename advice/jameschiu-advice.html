			<h4>Don't be discouraged!</h4>
			<p>Every single step needs practice and LOTS of it! You can't fast track it at all</p>

			<p>You're not going to know it right away and barely remember half of the codes so <strong>KEEP THOSE CHEATSHEETS!</strong></p>

			<h4>Learning is difficult</h4>
			<p>From simple HTML to crazy JavaScript none of it is easy to learn at first but keep messing with it. </p>

			<p>You're basically learning a new language you never heard of, I still don't know how to say "hi" in any other language besides english or spanish...</p>

			<p>Key thing is is to remember to stay focused over look your code several times VALIDATE is key!.</p>
