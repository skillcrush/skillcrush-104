			<h4>You can figure anything out!</h4>
			<p>Even if something seems completely out of your realm of understanding, just keep putting one foot in front of the other.</p>

			<p>You never know when you're going to discover how to do something new. And it feels so amazing when it clicks!</p>

			<h4>Ask for help AFTER you've tried everything.</h4>
			<p>Even though you may feel alone at your computer, you're not.</p>

			<p>Everyone was a beginner once. And most people enjoy helping others.</p>

			<p>After you've tried your best, reach out and ask for help. You'll be amazed at how generous people are with their knowledge and experience.</p>
