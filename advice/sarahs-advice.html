			<h4>Keep going!</h4>
			<p>No one is born a master, so always be kind and patient with yourself. Don't rush through an assignment just to stay on track. There will be many times when you feel overwhelmed, frustrated and like don't ever want to write a single line of code again. Don't worry! That doesn't mean that you don't have what it takes to be an amazing coder. It just means that you need a little break - <br>take it!</p>
