			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>No matter how confused and frusturated you get, don't abandon your learning journey! Some days will be great, and you'll pick up concepts quickly, and others will seem slow with concepts that you just can't seem to grasp.</p>

			<p>Take a deep breath (and a break!), clear your mind, and then get in there, and get back at it.</p>

			<p>In the words of the late and great Aaliyah - "<span id="taqwa-advice-italic">If at first you don't succeeeeed...dust yourself off and try again. You can dust it off and try again (try again)!</span>"</p>
