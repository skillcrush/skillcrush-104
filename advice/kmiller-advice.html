			<h4>Embrace challenges!</h4>
			<p>I learned html and css about five years ago and only dabble a little here and there. I can go for months without coding which makes me feel like a beginner everytime I have a project and start programming... so I spend a lot of time refreshing what I think I know and realize there's a lot of what I don't know!</p>

			<p>Confusion, it always seems to be there, but there always seems to be someone else who's asked the same question before. Beginners don't quit, and dig deep, there is help out there.</p>

			<h4>Asking for help is key</h4>
			<p>When you are stuck or start feeling overwhelmed just remember, someone is out there ready to help! Google, google, google everything, and if you're taking an on-line class don't be shy to ask for help, chances are someone's already been through the same challenge.  And if your class is with Skillscrush, well they have some great folks working there and they always make you feel great about helping you.</p>

			<h4>Solutions are there</h4>
			<p>When you find a solution, write it down, be specific with the steps you took to resolve the matter. Keeping good notes when unusual challenges present themselves is your best practice.</p>
