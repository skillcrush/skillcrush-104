		<h2><em>Go with the flow!</em></h2>

			<p><em>No seriously, stay with me a moment.</em></p>

			<p> <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Creative flow</a></strong> is a psychological term that defines the way people operate when they "get into their zone." The concept is that when people perform an activity they enjoy, they can become fully immersed, focused, and productive with said activity. You'll know your experiencing your state of "flow" when you work at a task and realize how time seems to fly, and/or when the task you're doing doesn't feel like "work," even without you realizing it.</p>

			<p>I experience my flow whenever I play a fun videogame, when I work on illustrations, and when I write stories about my personal characters. I never expected that I would feel this same phenomenon while coding, certainly not when I first decided to enroll in Skillcrush. But a few days into my 101 class, I realized that I was experiencing flow while I was working on the code for my portfolio -- sometimes for <em>hours</em> while trying to clean up my stylesheets, or while troubleshooting a bug until I fixed the problem. It was a welcome discovery, because it reinforced the idea that "I can actually do this! And I can enjoy it too!!"</p>

			<p>You may not get the exact same experience as me, but if you find yourself experiencing any type of "flow" during part of you Skillcrush classwork -- whether it's more with development or with design -- I suggest you keep going in that direction. You just might find a new knack for tech that you didn't realize you had before.</p>
			
			<p>(At the same time, <em>please</em> take breaks too. As I mentioned, flow is notorious for making you lose your sense of time, and you'll need your energy and a clear head when you begin doing this regularily -- With that said, best of luck!)</p>
