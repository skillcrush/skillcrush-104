			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>Generally when I am confused in this class, it is from one of two things.  First, I did not do the steps in the order indicated.  Sometimes you need to erase what you have done, go back to square one, and start again following directions exactly as shown.</p>

			<p>Second, if the instructions seem confusing, it is usually because I haven't gone ahead to the right tab.  The instructions are given in a later lesson and I just need to go and check them out before getting frustrated.</p>
