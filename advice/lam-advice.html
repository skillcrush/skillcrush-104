			<h4>Use it or lose it!</h4>
			<p>Practice makes perfect...or at least makes you somewhat proficient.</p>

			<p>Going through the challenges then taking the time to make up your own challenges is key to drilling in all that you have learned.</p>

			<h4>Resources, like Google and OneNote, are your friend!</h4>
			<p>Sometimes it's faster to google your problem than digging around in the resources you have amassed.</p>

			<p>OneNote or another note taking tool with full text search is super helpful when you are in a jam.</p>

			<p>Being married to a developer/IT guy helps as well.  I just ask him.  But then he tells me to Google it!!</p>
