			<h4>Perfect Is The Enemy Of Good</h4>
			<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up"></span>When you start to code, you might have the thought that your site "isn't good enough" or "just a few more tweaks and it will be perfect."</p>

			<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up"></span>So you delay and delay and put off "shipping" the project.  Meanwhile your client (even if it's you) is getting impatient because they want to launch.</p>

			<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up"></span>Remember websites are ALWAYS "works in progress."  Better to launch something that can be tweaked and evolved continuously, than to delay and produce nothing.</p>
