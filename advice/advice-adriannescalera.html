			<h4>There is a season!</h4>
			<p>HTML & CSS take a lot of patience and time. Uninterrupted time is best, I don't have too much of that but I try it use it as effciently as I can. Don't get frustrated if you feel the class moves too fast.</p>

			<p>If you read about the coding topics in books and do lessons from other websites, it'll help you understand the ideas more instead of just memorizing to get through it.</p>

			<h4>You'll have so much more respect for every website you visit!!</h4>
			<p>Wow! Since I began this course and seen first hand how much time and knowledge goes into every part of every website site I visit, I appreciate good design for the end user even more so.</p>
			<p>Having a well though out plan before beginning to code will shine through in the websites you develop.</p>

			<p>In the end I think most of us began this journey because we knew we could do better than a drop and drag site, right?</p>
