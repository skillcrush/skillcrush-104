			<h3>Confusion: Slow down and reflect!</h3>
			<p>Confusion is NOT your friend because it is a state of mind you do not want to be stuck in. It is just a signal that needs your immediate attention so you can do something to make it go away. If you get confused, something is wrong or amiss. Always refer to the resources available when you do not understand something. Or, better yet, figure out the solution on your own. When you find a solution, you slay the confusion and will be able to move forward. Progamming can be tough to do, but confusion is nothing more than an obstacle to success.</p>

			<h3>Anxiety/Fear: Smash through and keep going!</h3>
			<p>You might feel that you need to give up because you are afraid you would not success at it or make too many mistakes for your comfort. Hey, stop that. You want results? Just ignore the fear and keep going. Eventually, you will nail these skills down! It is like riding a bike down the long hill despite how scary it is. You fall down many times and get hurt, but you get back on the bike and learn how to ride it no matter what! Just like skiing. That's how you get results you need.</p>
