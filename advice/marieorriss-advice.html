			<h2>Don't Give Up!</h2>
			<p>Sometimes <span>you will get stuck </span> and want to bang your head into the keyboard trying to make something work. This would happen to me sometimes when figuring out breakpoints in responsive design. Take a deep breath, <span>take a break and then go back to it.</span> Most of the time you find your solution shortly there after.</p>

			<p>Use your skillcrush google groups to ask questions. There is no such thing as a stupid question! I also find I can get find solutions to my questions on stackoverflow.com and w3schools.com.</p>

			<h2>Stay Focused!</h2>
			<p>Remember <span>why you are learning</span> to code and set goals for yourself. For me it was to transition to a new job where I can apply my web development skills. I focused to finish <a href="http://marieorriss.com" target_blank ><span>my portfolio</span></a> to showcase the HTML and CSS skills I have already learned to hopefully land a new role utilizing those skills while finishing up the program and diving into javascript. <span>Good Luck and Happy Coding!</span></p>
