			<h4>Watch and Read all different kinds of tutorials!</h4>
			<p>Even if it's on a skill you think you have already conquered. Sometimes someone else can explain a topic that makes
			you think about it in a completely different way or allows you to understand it a little bit better. Use all of the resources you
			can get your hands on! </p>

			<p></p>

			<h4>Don't give up!</h4>
			<p>There have been plenty of times where I wanted to throw in the towel and pretend like I had never given this
			coding thing a shot. But just when I'm about to give up, I somehow manage to find the solution to whichever problem I was having.
		  You just have to keep trying, practicing, and learning. Your patience and persistence will
		 	pay off!</p>
