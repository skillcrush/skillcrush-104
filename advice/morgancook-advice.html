			<h4 class="morgancook-advice">Diversify!</h4>
			<p class="morgancook-advice-p">When you start programming, there's so much information out there that it can be overwhelming. But that volume of information is also your friend. Once, you have decided what language you want to learn, make sure that you attack it from multiple mediums. This way if one tuturial, or one book, or one class, doesn't explain a concept in the best way for you to learn it, you have another tuturial, class, or book that can hammer the concept home. This diversity will reinforce your learning while also deepening your understading as a whole.</p>

			<p class="morgancook-advice-p">So take a tuturial, then find a book or article that covers the same topic and see what happens!</p>
