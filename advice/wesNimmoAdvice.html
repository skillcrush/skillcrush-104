			<h4>1. The Inevitable Wall</h4>
			<p>When you get stuck and can't move forward because somethng is broken, not working the way it is supposed to and you can't move on- think of these moments as opportunities to get better. Everytime you troubleshoot something and get it fixed- whether solving yourself or finding help through stack overflow, or google search, it makes you that much stronger. See these moments not as obstacles but as opportunities.</p>


			<h4>2. Put the mouse down and step away from the computer...</h4>
			<p>Do not forget to take breaks, and give your mind and eyes a break. Often times when you come back to the comuter after a break you see things you weren't seeing before due to fatiugue or diminishing returns of mental exertion.</p>
