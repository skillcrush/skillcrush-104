			<h4>We were all newbies</h4>
			<p>Learning something new makes you a newbie, a beginner but remember every expert had to learn this at one point. We were all noobs at one point in our careers</p>

			<p>So just always remember that no question is silly and you are probably asking something that someone else wants to ask</p>

			<h4>Always keep learning</h4>
			<p>Never stop learning. You need to always be reading, following the leaders in the industry and challenging yourself</p>
