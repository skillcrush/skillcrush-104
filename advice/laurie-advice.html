				<ul>
					<li>When you start learning how to create websites, there's gonna be a lot of new information. But you just have to take it one info at a time.</li>
					<li>It's ok to check back for the right code, element, property, spelling of anything. It helps you remember it later on.</li>
					<li>Not everything makes sense the first time you see it, but trust that it works and eventually you'll undestand why.</li>
					<li>Confusion is your friend!</li>
					<li>Practice daily if possible. It's ok to take time off and enjoy life, but always come back to coding.</li>
					<li>Ask questions, look for answers when you don't know something. The internet is an incredible source of information.</li>
					<li>Don't be too hard on yourself. Nobody is perfect, and it's totally ok to make mistakes as long as you learn from them.</li>
					<li>Experiment with your new knowledge and explore your new resources. </li>
					<li>Don't give up!</li>
				</ul>
				<p>And enjoy the journey!!!</p>
