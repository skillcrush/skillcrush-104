							<h4>Congraturations! You've finish the most difficult part.</h4>
							<p>The most difficult part that I was talking about was signed up for the Skillcrush! Now that all you need to do is focus and stick to the lessen plan and practice, practice, and practice!</p>
							<p>Don't give up. I'm sure some days are slow and you may not be able to go as fast as you would hoped for but keep trying, eventually you will finish the course and get the job you always dreamed of having. :)
