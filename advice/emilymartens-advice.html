			<h4>It's never too late to start over!</h4>

			<p>Perhaps you spent your entire life letting other people tell you what you should be doing. Perhaps even though you are extremely good at math and science, because you are female, no one encouraged you to pursue a career in a S.T.E.M. field. Perhaps you didn't have a clue what you wanted to do, and none of your plans turned out to be right. Whatever your tale might be, it is never too late to rewrite your story.</p>

			<h4>Don't Let Them Scare You!</h4>
			<p>Whenever you decide to do something unexpected, there will always be someone who wants to tell you all the reasons why you're crazy to try something new. They'll tell you you're too old, that's too hard, women can't do that, and whatever other negative thing they've had branded into their brains by societal programming. Instead of listening to the naysayers, seek out positive support: </p>
