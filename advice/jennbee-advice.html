			<h4>Google is your friend!</h4>
			<p>How did anyone ever learn anything before the days of the internet and Google? I can't tell you how many times someone has asked me how to do something and I Googled the answer for them. I look super duper smart, but really I'm just lazy! 99 out of 100 times, Google has the answer for you. Sometimes you may have to do a little more digging than other times, but you'll always find the answer -- and learn something! -- in the end.</p>

			<h4>Keep On Keeping On</h4>
			<p>Learning is harder the older we get. It doesn't come as naturally and if we don't pick something up immediately we sometimes have a tendency to give up because it seems like it's too hard and will be too much effort. But nothing worth having is ever easy! Try to focus more on the journey and less on the destination. You may find your destination changes the further along in your journey you get. Maybe you wanted to design WordPress themes but along the way discovered you were much more interested in Responsive Web Design. Life is full of surprises. Don't miss out because something didn't show up in the way you originally expected.</p>

			<h4>Always Have Fun!</h4>
			<p>I wish someone had told me this sooner. Not the part about having fun, but HOW to have fun. The answer is fillmurray.com.</p>
			<p>Always, always fill murray.</p>
