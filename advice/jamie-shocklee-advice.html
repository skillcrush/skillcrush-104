			<h4>Advice from a Tree</h4>
			<p>Dear friend
	    Stand tall and proud<br>
	    Sink your roots deeply into the Earth<br>
	    Reflect the light of your true nature<br>
	    Think long term<br>
	    Go out on a limb<br>
	    Remember your place among all living beings<br>
	    Embrace with joy the changing seasons<br>
	    For each yields its own abundance<br>
	    The energy and birth of spring<br>
	    The growth and contentment of summer<br>
	    The wisdom to let go of leaves in the fall<br>
	    The rest and quiet renewal of winter<br>
	    Feel the wind and the sun<br>
	    And delight in their presence<br>
	    Look up at the moon that shines down upon you<br>
	    And the mystery of the stars at night<br>
	    Seek nourishment from the good things in life<br>
	    Simple pleasures Earth, fresh air, light<br>
	    Be content with your natural beauty<br>
	    Drink plenty of water<br>
	    Let your limbs sway and dance in the breezes<br>
	    Be flexible<br>
	    Remember your roots<br>
	    Enjoy the view!</p>
