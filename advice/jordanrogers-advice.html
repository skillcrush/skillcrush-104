			<h4>Consistency is important!</h4>
			<p>We all know that. If you're an aspiring pianist, you practice every day, even if it's just for a few minutes. The same goes for learning to code.</p>

			<p>I was pretty consistent when I started learning HTML and CSS, but then life got in the way and I wasn't able to practice every day. Now I'm having to go back and re-learn some things, which takes time away from new things I could be learning. </p>

			<h4>Go figure it out!</h4>
			<p>There will be times when you won't get all the information you need to be successful from whatever class or curriculum you are following. You'll need to forage through the internet wilderness for help, ideas, and solutions.</p>

			<p>Don't get too caught up looking for the perfect answer though. If you find something you think might work, try it out! Try things even if you're not sure what will happen. All the failures just help you get more comfortable with the code, and when you finally get it, you will definitely be proud of yourself knowing you were the one who made it work.</p>
