			<h2>It's ok to ask for help!</h2>
			<p>When you get discouraged, take a step back, take a deep breath, think through how you will ask for help, and as you prepare your question, you might just figure out the answer for yourself!</p>
			<p>However, if you don't figure it out, never beat yourself up for too long before you ask for help.
				The group chat through Slack and the support you'll receive are some of the great benefits that are part of the Skillcrush package.</p>
			<p>Also, keep an eye on the Slack group for your module.</p>
				<p>You might find that you gained an answer before you knew it was a question.</p>
				<h2>Challenges are rewarding!</h2>

				<p> Learning can be hard. If it wasn't a challenge, you wouldn't be learning, you'd be bored.
				<br>One of the hard parts about learning is that struggles are how you know you've stepped up to a challenge!</p>
				<h2>Don't give up, and don't fret! This is your moment to shine!</h2>
