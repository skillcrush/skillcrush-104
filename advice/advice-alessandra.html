			<h4>Confusion is your friend</h4>
			<p>When I started learning Ruby with Skillcrush, I was in a hurry to learn fast and become a professional developer, thus I was
			always annoyed when I made mistakes or something was not clear to me. I found myself wondering whether that was a suitable career path for me. 
			BUT... This is NOT an efficient way to learn! I found myself learning
			and retaining code much more effectively just trying to solve errors step by step and focus on what I have to do in that very moment, without worrying
			too much and overthinking. 
			When you learn to fix an error, you gain a better understanding of the coding logics and remember things much better.</p>

			<p>I bet you don't like feeling confused and lost... Well, same here! But you will learn to love it as a part of your job and...
			you can  still google for help : D !
			It can take time though... Just try, even in this case, to stay on what you are working on, don't get into endless research trying to 
			learn everything related to that topic. 
			It will be easier and more useful.</p>
