			<h4>There's Always A Solution</h4>
			<p>Sometimes, all this coding stuff makes perfect sense. You're chugging right along, and everything is behaving as expected. And then, surprise! Something goes wrong and you have no idea why. You look and you search and you google, and you swear you've done everything perfectly. You pull out some of your hair and scan your code over and over and over. You start to think, "there's no solution to this, I'm screwed!"</p>

			<p>Wrong. There's always a solution. It's usually very simple. It might even be obvious. But it's there somewhere. And you will find it, eventually.</p>

			<h4>Take A Breather.</h4>
			<p>And this is why sometimes, you just need to walk away for a minute. Take a few breaths, leave your hair on your head where it belongs, and have a little break already. It's all too easy to panic and let frustration take over.</p>

			<p>Chances are, you will find your solution when you come back. Maybe you need only wait 5 minutes, or maybe you should wait until tomorrow. When you come back, refreshed and relaxed, you'll be looking at your project with new eyes.</p>

			<p>Worst case scenario, have someone else look at it for you. Coding mistakes are usually tiny. A missed semicolon, a simple typo, or one piece of code out of place. It can be tough to spot when you've been staring at it for hours. But trust me, you will make it out of this alive.</p>
