			<h4>Don't be afraid to ask questions!</h4>
			<p>In school, we are used to being tested on what we have memorized. How well we can parrot back the views we've been taught, and how well we can work through specific algorthms. Not already having the answer in your head is failure, and trying to look for the answer in the middle of a test is cheating</p>
			<p>In coding, however, it's IMPOSSIBLE to know everything you need to know when your first starting out. In fact, I've heard many professionals say it's impossible to know everything period. Technology moves at such a rapid pace you'd have to have a computer brain to keep it all in!</p>
			<p>'Google is your friend' is a phrase I've heard over and over again on this coding journey. And while the best of the best will have specific keystrokes and syntax ready at their fingertips, there's always something to look up or verify or double check before you execute</p>
			<p>Don't try to memorize everything. Instead, learn how to ask the right questions.</p>
