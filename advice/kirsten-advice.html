			<h2>Keep Learning</h2>
			<p>When you start, it may all seem pretty easy. If you've learned some of this before, or are picking it up quickly, don't get complacent.
			<br>There is a lot to learn. So remember, it won't all go smoothly. </p>

			<h2>Investigate any Suggested Resources ... <span class="emphasis-1">and </span>... Find Your Own</h2>
			<p>Additional resources can be interesting and helpful. Some have even helped get me out of self-created jams.</p>

			<h2>Approach Coding as an Adventure!</h2>
			<p>Look forward to each new piece you learn.
				<br>Let learning to code take on a whole new meaning.
				<br>Have fun!</p>
