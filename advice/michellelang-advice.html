			<h4>Don't give Up!</h4>
			<p>This is your new motto when learning to code.  Everything looks like a foreign language until you start recognizing the symbols.  When your sentences (code) speak some foul language, your computer will yell back.  Yet don't take it to heart.  You two will communicate eventually.</p>

			<p>Just like dating, you'll slowly figure out what he or she likes and 'Does Not' like.  So aim to please but expect a little feedback.  It all gets easier as time goes by. You'll eventually read the signals and figure it out before it all goes the wrong way.</p>

			<h4>Exploration is your new activity!</h4>
			<p>Google will become your new best friend, as well as stackoverflow and stack exchange.  Try your own code first but listen to their advice, since improving yourself is the goal.</p>

			<p>Your code will seem lame compared to these pros but eventually you improve step by step and will not rely on them so much. Read, read, read, I can't say this enough.  The more you read the more you know and then practice, practice, practice.</p>

			<p>As a former Fortran programmer, symbols and attributes are familiar but all this Ruby is Greek to me!!</p>
