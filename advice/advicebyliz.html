			<h4>Know that it's hard!</h4>
			<p>Just know that's its going to be hard at points.  That you are going to struggle.  And if you don't, that's ok too.  At the beginning I heard how hard it was but really it was all about how each of us learn.  I'm still struggling with CSS but I'm learning.  And that's all I can do.</p>

			<h4>WORK the system!</h4>
			<p>I'll be honest, there were parts that I thought I had to figure out on my own...but I didn't.  I was able to work the system that's provided to get to where I needed to be. It was amazing and made my life so much easier./>

			<h4>  SHOW UP!</h4>
			<p> Seriously, show up to those office hours or send an e-mail.  It makes a huge difference and you can get a quick response!  I was absolutely amazed!</p>
