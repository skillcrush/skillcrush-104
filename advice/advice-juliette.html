			<h4>You Can Do It!</h4>
			<p>Coding is tough. It's both learning a new language and a new way of thinking. You will get lost. You will get frustrated. You will want to shut down your computer and never look at another piece of code ever again. But you know what? That's just the nature of the beast. Every coder has felt that way at some point in their lives. Some coders will even tell you that they feel that way at least once a week!</p>

			<p>My advice? Keep your head up. Tell yourself that you can do it. Coding is a lot like learning to ride a bike. You will fall. You will scrape your knee. It will hurt. You will never want to do it again. But after a little bit of practice every single day, you will get to where you want to be.</p>

			<h4>How I've Learned to Code</h4>
			<p>I'm a big believer in creating to-do lists and setting goals. Once I set a goal, such as learning HTML &amp; CSS, I write it down, as well as every step I can think of in order to get to that goal. One step was to complete the Skillcrush web development path. I then broke that step down into a list of every video I had to watch and every assignment I needed to do in order to complete this step. Then, I pulled up my calendar and carved out the time to complete every single step in the Skillcrush web development path. Rinse and repeat. With a little bit of time and a little bit of discipline, I can now say that I am confident in my HTML &amp; CSS abilities.</p>

			<p>Create lists of tiny goals. Carve out time to learn them. Keep your head up and simply focus on your small goals. You got this!</p>
