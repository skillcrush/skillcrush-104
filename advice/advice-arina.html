			<p>To have the bug-free code that does that awesome thing, you first need the possibly buggy code that tries to do that awesome thing.
			It's often faster and better to first write some bad code, have it fail, and then debug it into shape, than to stare at a blank editor,
			trying to come up with perfect code that will work on the first run.</p>
