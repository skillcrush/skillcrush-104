				<h2>Make a Structured Learning Plan</h2>
				<p>When I first learning to code I thought that by consuming lots of online tutorials and reading books cover to cover would equate to more knowledge.
				The problem with this approach is that it leads to information overload
				and you end up only retaining about 20% of it anyway, and it can lead to a lot of burn out, frustration and wasted time.

				<p>A far more effcient and effective approach is to join a stuctured online programmme like <a href="https://learn.skillcrush.com">Skillcrush!</a> They have already done the hard work of researching and working out what you need to learn and what is not needed for each design skill or code language. The best part is they package all this up into a guided learning path that will keep you focussed on a straight and narrow path with support along the way from fellow class mates and instructors.  I can totally vouch for their course programmes because I have taken them, and they are just awesome!</p>
				</p>

				<p>Trust me when I say that <a href="https://learn.skillcrush.com">Skillcrush!</a> is the best and quickest way to learn a coding language or design skill you are intrested in taking up, rather than the alternative of learning on your own in isolation, with no one to keep your accountable on your progress and having your learning scattred in to many diffrent directions.</p>

				<h2>Put in the Hours</h2>
				<p>I can't stress just how important this is but if you want to have a successful career in Web Design & Development then you need to put in the time to practice what you learn over and over again to really ingrain the skill so that it eventually becomes second nature.  When what you are learning about comes natural to you, you then free up some more mental space in your brain to learn something more about it.</p>
				<p>The legendary Basketball player Shaquille O'Neal once said:</p>
				<blockquote><q>Excellence is not a singular act, but a habit.  You are what you repeatedly do.</q></blockquote>

				<h2>Take Care of Yourself</h2>
				<p>While hours of practise is whats required to really master any design skill or coding language you need to supliment this desire to learn with plenty of breaks, regular exercise and 8hours of sleep per night.  Rest and recuporation is so important for the body and mind to recharge your own brain batteries after a long day spent in front of the screen, and you need this if you want to be at your most productive.  I use to think that a few more hours spent late into the night learning more in sacrifice of my sleep would be benefit me but it doesn't and cutting into time that should be spent asleep will only hurt you in the long run. - so get some sleep!</p>
