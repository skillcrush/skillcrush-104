			<p>I could give you some advice, but I'd actually just like to give you some encouragement. If you have made it this far, you are doing great! Whether it has taken you 1-2 weeks to get to this point of Skillcrush 105, or 1-2 months or longer, you are making progress - and that's what matters.</p>
			<p>Continue putting one foot in front of the other. Whether you are making it through multiple lessons per day or barely one step of one lesson a day, you are moving forward.</p>
			<p>I signed up for my first Skillcrush blueprint way back in 2014. After getting past some mental hurdles and some of those curve balls that life throws at you sometimes, I am finally Skillcrushing it!</p>
			<p>Don't forget to enjoy the journey you are on. While there will definitely be times that you'll make mistakes and be yelling "Whyyyyy???" at your screen, those are the lessons that you'll remember the best and laugh at the most when you are looking back a couple of months or a couple of years from now.</p>
			<p>I want to thank the wonderful staff at Skillcrush for having this advice page for newbies. As I was scrolling down through the list of people that have left their mark on this page, I felt incredibly encouraged. Thank you Skillcrush, for this page, and for everything you do!</p>
