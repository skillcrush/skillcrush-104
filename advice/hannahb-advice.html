                	<p>Have you ever tried to learn anything before? Then chances are you have beat yourself up about not being able to learn something as fast as your peers do, or as fast as you feel you should. I urge you, the next time you don't immediately 'get' something, don't waste any time or energy on self-doubt, and instead work on filling the knowledge gaps in your  foundation. Your brain is capable of learning almost anything; you just have to nurture it in the right way!</p>

                	<p>Sometimes you just want to get the work done, sign off, and head to the pub. I get it. But on occasions where you find yourself with a bit of time up your sleave I encourage you to break and unbreak your code, research best practices or alternative ways of doing things, heck do anything! You'll never find a better opportunity to learn something than whilst working on a real project. You'll thank yourself later.</p>

                	<p>This is the most common piece of advice I hear from web developers. After 1.5 months of intensively learning/practicing code, I can confirm that there's something to be said for immersion! You don't have to spend so much time picking up where you left off, things that you've learnt tend to be more fresh in your mind, and most importantly you build up momentum in your coding endeavours so before long you feel unstoppable!</p>
