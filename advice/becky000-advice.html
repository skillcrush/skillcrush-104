			<h2>"For the beginner, practice without effort is not practice."
			<br><em>&mdash; Shunryu Suzuki</em></h2>
		
			<p>Confusion is not your enemy; it is your teacher. The more you struggle with confusion, the more painful it will be. When you let yourself walk away for a breath of fresh air, your mind will continue solving its problems in the background. When your mind is open it allows understanding to enter.</p>

			<p>Keep reading. Keep practicing. Compare different ways of coding the same solution. And keep moving forward. When you feel overwhelmed look to experienced programmers for advice. Above all else, keep motivated. Your code, my code, all of our code is connecting the world in amazing ways. </p>
