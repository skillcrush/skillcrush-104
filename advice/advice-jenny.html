			<h4>The desire to learn</h4>
			<p>When I first started my coding journed with Skillcrush, I already had an 8-week Intro-to-WebDesign class under my belt.  All the projects in Week 1 and Week 2 seemed relatively easy.  The language was familiar and I could complete a lesson pretty quickly.</p>

			<p>Then Week 3 started and things got harder.  Lessons introduced new concepts.  Things that I hadn't heard of before.  Answers didn't come so easy.  Things were no longer intuitive.  Lessons took longer.  Suddenly the television became more attractive after work than doing my homework.  I had meals to cook, and laundry to do, and books to read.</p>

			<h4>Make time</h4>
			<p>Yes, things were harder.  And sometimes lessons took longer.  But the key to it all was simply to start.  Once I started on a lesson I became engrossed.  Once I began, I could carry on through.</p>

			<p>Sometimes I wasn't quite as interested, or I could feel my mind wandering.  But by starting on a lesson, and by virtue of the fact that the lessons were in manageable chunks, I would find that I could make it through to the completion of the lesson.</p>
			
			<h4>Just do it</h4>
			<p>So, I have learned that I have to set myself a schedule and then stick to it.  When I'm scheduled to do a lesson I pull up to my desk with my laptop, my notebook, some colorful pens and a cup of tea.  I set the timer on my phone for an hour and a half.  And then I just do it.  Most days the hour and a half is enough.  Sometimes it spills over, either into an extra session later in the evening or, occasionally, into the next day or the weekend.  But the important thing is to just do it.</p>
			
			<p>By the end of the week the lessons are complete.  I try to take time to reflect on everything I learned, both in the past week, and since the beginning of the blueprint.  I am amazed at how far I've come in just a few weeks.  From having the most basic knowledge of html, to being able to code a basic static website.  From thinking a git is a jerk of a guy, to having a GITHUB account.  So much can be learned by setting yourself a manageable schedule and then just doing it.</p>
