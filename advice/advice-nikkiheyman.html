			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Fake it til' you make it.</h4>
			<p> It is so easy to feel like you will never be a true coder. Learning new things is hard. Learning coding, especially, can seem like a daunting task. I think the important thing is to keep trying. Even coders I know who have been doing it for a long time say that they learn something new every day. Surround yourself with supportive and inspiring people and the rest will come. </p>
