			<h4>Don't Stop!</h4>
			<p>When I was first learning to code, there were many moments where I'd get stuck and not know how to continue. The biggest mistake I made was deciding to get back to it later and never got back trying to figure it out.</p>
			<p>If I could go back and give myself some advice, I'd tell myself to just keep going and don't give up at the first sign of confusion. Get back to it atleast within 24 hours so that you don't lose your momentum.</p>
			<h4>Keep Going!</h4>
			<p>It's normal to encounter problems and be confused when you're learnin something new.</p>
			<p>Don't let these feelings deter you from your goal.</p>
