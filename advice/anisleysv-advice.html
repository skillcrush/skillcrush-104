			<h4>Practice, practice and practice!</h4>
			<p>When you start learning tech you need to know your best way to learn, each one have a different way to improve the learning method. Nevertheless I have found that is always the best idea to put hands on the work while learning.</p>

			<p>The best advice I can give you is to put in practice every knowledge you learn. If the content is too theoretical and extense try searching explanations from different persons, also take the clearest, simplest explanation to start understanding, record it with your own voice and listen it repeatedly until every concept is familiar to you.</p>

			<h4>Trust in your capacity.</h4>
			<p> The process can be long, there will be bored moments and passioned ones. Don't hesitate to force you go through the entire process. Trust in your capacity and follow the dream... improve your future by learning new technologies is a reality, not an ilusion.</p>
