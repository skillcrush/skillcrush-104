			<h4>1. Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>If you're anything like me, you'll be completely confused when you first start coding. It all looks like a bunch of funky gibberish and you don't think you'll ever be able to make sense of it. Every time you start to code you'll forget the most basic things and feel like you're starting at square one. Trust me though, you WILL slowly start to "get it" and things will start to sink in. It really is just one of those "practice makes perfect" things.</p>

			<p>Everyone gets at least a little but confused when they're learning something new, and coding is no exception. It's just part of the learning process! Confusion is a sign that you're learning something you didn't know before.</p>

			<h4>2. Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
