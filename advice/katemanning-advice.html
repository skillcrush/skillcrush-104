			<h4>You are not an idiot!</h4>
			<p>Despite the fact that you will feel completely flummoxed and overwhelmed on a regular basis while you're first learning to code, please do not despair. You are not dim because you don't immediately understand something the first time (or even the 100th time). The important thing is to keep your head up and continue slogging ahead. Ignore anyone who says otherwise.</p>

			<h4>Absorb as many different opinions as possible.</h4>
			<p>Everyone (and I do mean EVERYONE) who codes has (occasionally bizarrely) strong opinions on which languages are the best, how to do certain things, and what best practices should be in every aspect of programming. Always listen politely to potential teachers -- every new bit of information helps -- but pay the closest attention to the majorities and authorities.</p>

			<h4>Practice, practice, practice.</h4>
			<p>Just like learning a new human language, learning to code is a continual process that requires constant use and attention. If you don't keep coding, you'll lose vocabulary, syntax, and "flow." The more you manage to think in code -- from imagining cool ways to build things to help in your real life to just copying code you see until you figure out what it does -- the faster you'll be "fluent." </p>
