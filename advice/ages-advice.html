			<h4>Don't be afraid to be a beginner!</h4>
			<p>Everyone has to start somewhere, so don't feel bad not knowing anything. </p>

			<p>No matter how old you are or where you are in life, it's never too late. Don't feel dumb for taking on a new venture of education no matter what your circumstance as there is no better way to spend your time or money than learning something new!</p>

			<h4>Don't quit!</h4>
			<p>You are going to get very frustrated and sometimes even question why you started this journey in the first place. Isn't it easier to do something else? Anything else? Maybe, but remember why you started this in the first place and don't give up!</p>

			<p>No matter how difficult you think things are, there have been many people in your shoes before who wouldn't be where they are today if they didn't stick with it.</p>

			<p>Remember that the Skillcrush teachers are always here to help you. Try solving problems first yourself and if you can't figure them out just shoot them a message! They are more than willing to help you out.</p>
