			<h4>Fake it til you make it!</h4>
			<p>When I started this class, I knew nothing about wordpress, or coding, or technology in general.</p>

			<p>Now that I've made it this far, I still don't know what's going on most of the time, BUT I keep up with the lessons and always seem to stay on track!</p>

			<h4>Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it!</h4>
			<p>People can't offer to help you if they don't know that you need it! Don't be embarrassed. We've all been there! Just ask.</p>

			<p>Stay positive and keep persevering!</p>

			<p>You can do it!</p>
