			<h4>Do not let the idea of learning to code be so daunting that you do not even try/h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Believe in yourself!</p>

			<h4>Learning to code is empowering!</h4>
			<p>If I would have know how awesome it feels to be able to control my computer from the command line, I would have started so much earlier!</p>

			<p>My boyfriend is jealous because I learned to make better website than he can make in under 2 weeks!</p>

			<p>Do NOT let yourself give up when you hit a wall. If you persist, you WILL get it.</p>
