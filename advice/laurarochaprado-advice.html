					<h2>The internet is your friend!</h2>
					<p>If you have no idea what all those funny names mean, do not panic. The internet is here to help! You will find out that everything that you ever wanted to know (and more!) is available in the web.</p>

					<p> There are tons of free resources and nice people to help you. Just make sure you know how to search correctly based on the questions you have.</p>

					<p>Most developers will tell you that they are constantly searching Google for issues that they run into. Ignorance is the norm, so do not feel stupid. Just go ahead and search, search, search.</p>

					<h2>Sometimes you just need a rest.</h2>
					<p>If you are stuck and it seems like you are not making progress at all at learning or solving something, just take a rest. We often get overwhelmed with all the new information we are acquiring, and we might feel lost and incapable. </p>

					<p>If you ever feel this way, do not think of yourself as a failure. Just take a rest. You will find that coming back to your process a couple of hours later, or even days later, will make you feel better and you are probably going to tackle that problem right away. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-lg-4">

					<h2>Anything is possible.</h2>

					<p>Do you have wild ideas? Crazy solutions for everyday problems? Do not keep your thoughts to yourself. Try to build something out of them! That is what programming is for. </p>

					<p>Start an open-source project. If you ask nice, you will find lots of people willing to help you.
					I promise you are going to make great things now that you know how to code.<p>

					<p><span id="emphasis">Think big! Good luck in your journey.</span></p>
