			<p>When I opened myself up to programming, I was so hard on myself because I was confused! And being confused about something usually means incompetence (to me anyway). There's also those deep rabbit holes I had to deal with, and being afraid of choosing the wrong one. Experts advised me that I need to be good at Googling. But how can you know what to ask? What choices are available when not knowing whats possible?</p>

			<p>What I learned about myself is that I stuck with the struggles like a masochistic fool. But that taught me so much. From gained patience, I handled better ways to problem solve and knowing how to ask for help and when. Heck, I even began meditating as it helped me problem solve towards a base case (pun intended) The point is to stick to it. Even if it feels like you're going no where. Stick to it until you feel like you've exhausted all your options. Believe me, you will get an answer before this happens. </p>

			<p>Before you throw your laptop out the window, remember that frustration is normal when programming. You'll run into bugs and not know what you did wrong. It's kind of like accupuncture, where needles are placed on the leg when the problem is just a headache. The point is, you'll grow to know what nerves are connected to what. Just treat your program like a sick patient. He/she knows not whats wrong, and thats why you're there to fix it. This thinking also prevents you from throwing your patient out your window.</p>
