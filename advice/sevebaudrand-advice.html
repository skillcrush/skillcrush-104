            <h4>Practice practice practice !</h4>
            <p>Perseverance is key. Try again and again until you get the exact result you wanted. Then start all over again! I think copying/cloning a page that already exists is a perfect exercise. Feeling overwhelmed is okay, it's part of the process. Just keep trying, I promise you'll find the solution.</p>

			<h4>Google is your best friend</h4>
			<p>All the answers are already out there. When you encounter a problem, you can be sure another developer encountered and solved it before, so learn how to ask the right questions on Google, and you'll find all your answers. <br>And don't hesitate to ask the help of other developers online, on <a href="www.stackoverflow.com">Stackoverflow</a> for example.</p>

			<h4>Get over the Imposteur Syndrome</h4>
			<p>Trust me, more than once, you're gonna feel so discouraged at the thought of how little you actually know and the gigantic amount of things you still need to learn. A real slap in the face making you feel like "Who am I kidding...". Fight these thoughts off! No need to compare yourself to others, there'll always be someone more skilled than you are, even after 20 years of coding. Instead focus on improving one skill at a time. Realize that  you can already build a website from scratch, and not many people can do that. Realize that even if you haven't learnt it yet, you can do almost anything by asking help online. You are already a developer, and that's all that matters really.</p>

			<h4>Have fun!</h4>
			<p>Be excited about learning and getting better. You're entering a fascinating world. Soon you'll be a coding ninja !</p>

			<h4>Contact me !</h4>
