			<h4>This is hard stuff!</h4>
			<p>Whoever said coding is easy lied.This stuff is not easy, but it so worth it! It take lost of dedication and time. I'm still very new to all of this, but learning to code has made me mroe resilient, and indeed happier.</p>

			<p>In order to cut down much of the confusion that comes with learning how to code you have to make some decisions.Do you want to be a front end developer or a fullstack developer? Do you prefer designing to code? Do you want to concentrate on websites or just apps? And if you do choose apps, well do you want to build android or iOS apps? See what I mean? It's easy to fall down the rabbit hole that is web development,but you should embrace it! If you like to learn, this is the place for you!</p>

			<h4>Community is Important</h4>
			<p>Finding people who are also learning to code is very important. You can attend meetups and conferences but you can also find a supportive community without ever leaving your house! Take advantage of social media.  Yes, social media is great for keeping up with your family and friends, but you should also leverage it to meet new influential people. You never know what kind of opportunities may come your way!</p>

			<p>Don't worry you will get there!</p>
