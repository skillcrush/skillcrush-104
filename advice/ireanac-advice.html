				<h4>Slow down.</h4>

				<p>If you're anything like me, you like to get things done and fast. Well, when it comes to learning how to code I have one piece of advice...SLOW DOWN!<br>There are some beautiful web applications out there and it is exciting knowing that we too can create such beautiful things. However, it takes time. I'm pretty sure it's impossible to learn how to code overnight; it takes diligence, patience, and determination. If we stick to it and slow down so that we really understand what we're doing, we will be successful!</br></p>
			
				<h4>What is happening?</h4>
				<p>As much as I don't really want to believe it, I think this is a question that regardless of experience, coders will always find themselves asking. When it comes to lines and lines of code, sometimes what we write in a file and what shows up on the screen, doesn't seem to correlate. Funky things can happen but never fret my friend, that's why we have each other!</p>
		
				<h4>Enjoy.</h4>

				<p>Just breathe and enjoy the journey. Technology is going to keep advancing which means we will never stop learning! Woohoo! Thinking about the amazing things we will be able to create in the future should motivate all of us to always be moving forward. To slow down, ask questions, and enjoy the journey.</p>
