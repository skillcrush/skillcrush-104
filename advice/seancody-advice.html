			<h4>Stay Consistent - Practice Daily</h4>
			<p>When you start programming, it can be easy to give up early when challenges arise.  But look at challenges as opportunities; you are learning!  Challenges are turned to victory by persisting until they are defeated.  If something is too difficult for you along, reach out to Google or the Skillcrush community for support.</p>

			<p>If what you are doing is easy, then are you really learning?</p>

			<h4>Learn from Multiple Sources</h4>
			<p>When you are learning something new, repetition is important to mastery. In addition to Skillcrush, seek out other opportunities to learn the development skills you are developing.</p>

			<p>Personally, I'm also working on the HTML/CSS and Javascript courses at <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Codeschool</a>.  By learning from both sources, different ideas are presented and applied in different ways, and become better retained in my mind.</p>
