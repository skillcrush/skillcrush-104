			<h4>Don't Give Up</h4>
			<p>I made the mistake of stopping when I got frustrated with Responsive Web Development. My excuse was always "Tomorrow. I'll work on it tomorrow." I ended up not working on anything for almost 6 months. This was obviously a huge set back as I had forgotten a lot of what I'd already learned. I began again having to do several lessons over again. I felt more stuck and frustrated but I decided that instead of dwelling on what I couldn't make sense of I was just going to go ahead and figure it out again later. It's actually helped and I've been much more motivated to keep practicing instead of giving up.</p>

			<h4>Focus on one language at a time.</h4>
			<p>It's very easy to be overwhelmed in tech when you're completely new to it. Ask anyone what language you should learn and they'll easily rattle off 5-6. I didn't know the difference between any of them, which were front end or back end. For a while, I thought it was expected that I had to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, Sass, Python, Ruby on Rails, jQuery and Swift. I thought It would take me forever to get a career I wanted</p>
			<p>I realize now that every tech position is different and requires a different set of languages. They all require the basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. Some don't need much more and some require knowledge of at least one back end language. It's a lot easier to figure out and learn once you just start and take it day by day.</p>

			<p>Money is my motivator! I'm constantly checking job postings for jobs that I could soon be applying for and the salary I could soon be making.</p>
