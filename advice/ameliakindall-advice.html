			<h4>Utilize other people</h4>
			<p>Being a tinkerer with a figure-it-out-yourself attitude is simultaneously the best and worst trait to have as a developer. On the one-hand, you know there is always a solution and dammit, you'll get there; on the other hand you tend to spend hours on end tinkering with a problem and going nowhere.</p>

			<p>It is just as important to give a problem all of your effort as it is to know when to reach out for help. So yes, struggle for a little bit -- it's crucial to your learning -- but reach out to someone when you've hit a wall. You'll end up saving yourself some hopelessness, frustration, and time.</p>

			<h4>Work on a project that you are passionate about</h4>
			<p>I have done many a coding tutorial and learned how to go through the motions of a language. In fact, I've probably learned and re-learned the fundamentals of some languages like three times. It wasn't until I had a real goal in mind for what I wanted to build in Ruby that it actually stuck.</p>

			<h4>You'll never feel 'ready'</h4>

			<p>You will never reach a point where you can say 'yes, I understand all there is to understand about programming, I can now go for that job'. We're learning in a field that is constantly shifting out from under us and expanding. You'll always just have to dive into the deep-end and swim.</p>
