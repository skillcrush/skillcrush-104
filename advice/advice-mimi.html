			<h4>Some Advice for Introverts (I know you're out there too)</h4>
			<p>I realize that sounded a little spooky. I am not here to spook you.</p>
			<p>However, I am here to tell you that if, like me, you're an anxiety-ridden impostor syndrome sufferer, you're super not alone.</p>
			<p>In fact, we're probably all just riding along being quiet. I don't like to participate in group discussions, for example. Really don't like it. But it's necessary for some lessons and good for progress. And life isn't all about comfort.</p>
			<p>Yeah, sucks a bit.</p>
			<p>But! Here's kind of what I tell myself. You've set a goal for a reason. And your reasons are your own, and as a fellow introvert, largely none of my business. And your this course and this subject matter are in line with your goals. You know what's probably not in line with your goals? Letting opportunities pass by due to inactivity due to anxiety.</p>
			<p>And I know I'm guilty of probably more than my fair share of nervous inaction. But no more! We are still safe behind our screens. It is okay.</p>
			<p><span>All will be well.</span></p>

			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
