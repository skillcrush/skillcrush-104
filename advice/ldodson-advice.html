			<h4>Making mistakes is acceptable!</h4>
			<p>When you start coding, you are going to make mistakes.  But do not worry! It is completely acceptable.</p>
			
			<h4>Part of the Learning Experience</h4>
			<p>Making mistakes is how we learn and it's the same with coding or programming.  By making mistakes, especially in a development environment, you learn to troubleshoot your own code</p>

			<p>You will learn to research problems that you may not know the answer to which in turn, allows you to experiment with new things.</p>

			<p>The great thing about coding, is that you can always fix your mistakes.  The next time you make a mistake that required a bit of troubleshooting on your part, be sure to document your mistake and the solution.  This will also help you remember how to prevent the mistake the next time.</p>
