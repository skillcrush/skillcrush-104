			<h4>Your Text Editor is Your Best Friend</h4>
			<p>When it comes to picking a text editor you must consider what you want out of it. You could simply use something like notepad for Windows or TextEdit on OS X and it would the trick. But it's not the best (or even close) option for coding modern web apps.</p>

            <p>Today you will hear of three very popular crossplatform text editors: <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>, <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a>, and <a href="http://atom.io">Atom</a>. While they all are very good editors and do basically the same things, some extensions required, There is no right editor to choose only the one that is right for you.</p>

			<h4>How to Choose an Editor</h4>
			<p>Google! Start by searching for what others think of the editors, check You Tube for reviews. Videos are a great way to see how they work and find out what they can do. Then download and installing the editor, or editors, you want to try, and play around. Install extensions, change your theme, write some code.</p>

			<p>If deciding between a couple of editors make a list of the features you can't live without. For example I really love the quick edit feature in Brackets, that lets you add css to your css files from inside you html doc. This is a feature I have not found in any other editor, making Brackets standout for me.</p>

			<p>Once you decide on an editor and have installed and configured your extensions and themes you will be one happy coder!</p>
