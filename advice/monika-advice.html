			<h2>Confusion is your friend!</h2>
			<p>When you start learning to code, you are doing something that you have never done before. Expect that to be challenging and frustrating at times, but never forget how rewarding it is to write a piece of code.<br>
			When I first started learning HTML, I was staring at someone else's code and I felt that they were so much smarter than me. Would I ever be able to catch up and create one of those terrific looking websites I was admiring? 
			I looked at other people's code and I was confused and intimidated. Glad, I did not let that stop me. 
			And then I realized, that much of the journey is just not giving up and practicing every day. 
			Practice, practice, practice, even if you can only squeeze in 10 minutes on a busy day. 
			Especially when learning a new language, it is easy to forget, unless one keeps working on it. 
			Picasso didn't start with a masterpiece either. He too, had to learn basic brushstrokes at some point in his life. 
			Learn how to use that brush and then start working on the masterpiece! </p>

			<h2>Don't be shy to ask!</h2>
			<p>There are millions of developers out there, who were exactly where you may find yourself right now. They understand where you come from, and they are happy to answer your questions. 
			It's totally ok to ask for help with your project, and this will also teach you to explain your issue and how to work with other programmers!<br>
			Learn by looking at other developer's code. Copy it, see if you can figure out what is does and how it does it. Play with it, break it, modify it, see what happens. 
			Then see, if you can find your own solution.</p>
