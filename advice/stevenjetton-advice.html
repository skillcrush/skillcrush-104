			<h4>Confidence is your new name!!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>You have made it this far!! Someboday say <span>"Confidence!"</span> Confidence, therefore, is your new attribute (get it? attribute?!). Anyway, it's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because you ARE <coding> already!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="section-two">
			<h4>Battle the lie with truth</h4>
			<p>If you are looking at an apple tree without apples, what kind of tree is it? Right, an apple tree. You call it an apple tree even if there are no apples on its branches at the moment. But, it's still an apple tree.</p>

			<p>It's a lie to say it's an orange tree or pear tree, because the truth is it's an apple tree. Like this apple tree without apples, you are a programmer and you are many steps ahead of the apple tree without apples because you have already produced apples (well, html and css in this case).</p>

			<p>You see then, you can call yourself a legit computer programmer and be <span>confident!</span></p>
