			<h4>Holy Guatamole</h4>
			<p>So many things happen when you start coding. Maybe you came in with prior knowledge and maybe you didn't. No matter where you came from you will hit some road blocks and that is ok!</p>

			<p>Those road blocks force you to be independent and test things out on your own. Don't be afraid to ask your student community, utilize google, or other fantastic resources out there like ww3schools.</p>

			<h4>Clear as water or Clear as mud?</h4>
			<p>Sometimes it will get swampy and you'll need to copy Copy COPY until you understand. It is normal, it is fine. If you feel like you are still saying clear as mud. Walk away give your brain a break and come back with fresh eyes. </p>

			<p>I had to do that with the Rough Pickings project... the first time was more than ROUGH and not a project I wanted to pick up. Second time it was easy and fantastic. </p>

			<p>You are learning a new language and you will learn at your own pace. Be patient, know you are a person of excellence, and you will make great things happen!</p>
