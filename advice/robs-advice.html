  			<h3>Stay humble!</h3>
  			<p>You will never know everything, especially in the art of programming.  Once you have mastered one thing, there is another facet of the programming world that will interest you.  <strong>Expand your mind!</strong>  Never stop learning.  Never hesitate to ask questions.</p>

        <h3>Stay amazed!</h3>
        <p>Technology is yours to control.  Before you think you've hit the limit, there's a million other things possible with your knowledge, and knowledge to gain by attempting all of the possibilities of technology.</p>

        <h3>Stay crazy!</h3>
        <p>Don't limit your thoughts.  The barriers that you put up are the only ones that exist.  Don't ever let anyone tell you something can't be done.  If they say it will be really hard and complicated, well there's a worthy challenge for yourself.</p>

        <p><strong>Remember</strong> that <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> is your friend.  The trick to finding anything you want on Google is just how to word your query.  When it comes to popular languages or technologies, there is a chance someone has run into the solution!  You can basically apply the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons_Already_Did_It">Simpsons Already Did It</a> mentality.</p>
