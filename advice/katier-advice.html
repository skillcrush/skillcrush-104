			<h4>Find a Community</h4>
			<p>This is good advice for anything, not just coding. Whether it's running on Monday mornings with a double stroller or trying to navigate the Terminal, having others who are also showing up is the most helpful thing there is. It keeps you honest and keeps you from feeling like a crazy person.</p><br>



			<h4>Go to Office Hours</h4>
			<p>Showing up at the office hours has that serendipity aspect to it. You get just as much out of listening to questions you never even thought to ask as those you brought along yourself.</p>

			<p>Even half an hour of seeing other people laugh and screw up makes me good for like 10,000 more miles of working solo.</p>

			<p>Finding other ways to connect, like podcasts and blog posts, has also kept me motivated. Hearing stories of how others have found their way makes the end goal seem attainable.</p>
