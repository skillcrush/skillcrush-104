	<p>My success was due to good luck, hard work, and support and advice from friends and mentors. But most importantly, it depended on me to keep trying after I had failed.</p>
  </div>
<div class="two"><p>Advice is like snow - the softer it falls, the longer it dwells upon, and the deeper it sinks into the mind.</p>
  </div>
<div class="three"><p>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.</p>
