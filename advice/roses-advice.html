			<h4>Just Begin!</h4>
			<p>I thought about IT 2 years ago. It somehow seemed like an impossible path for me. Now, all I can think about it is, what if I had just jumped in back then?</p>

			<p>If you're here then you have began your journey and now it can only be easier, you just have to keep coding. In a couple of years, you and I can both look back and be glad that we found the courage to put fingers to keyboard and code away.</p>

			<h4>There's always a solution</h4>
			<p>No matter how hard the task or how complex the problem seems to be, there's most definitely a solution. You might not see it right away but give it enough time and it will come to you. I promise!</p>

			<p>Don't be afraid to take a break. Recharging your batteries is an important part of this process.</p>

			<p>Celebrate small victories. Every little step you take is drawing you closer and closer to the day you will be an expert coder. So do stop now and then and just smile!</p>
