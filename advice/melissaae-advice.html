			<h4>Draw it. On paper. With a real pen or pencil.</h4>
			<p>Jumping right in can be a super fun way to just get going and get messy! Sometimes, you want to avoid messes, however. Stepping back with a pen and paper to visualize relationships and interactions, write down your order of operations, and making sense of it in a way you already know how can be extremely helpful.</p>

			<p>Not only does it force your brain thinking of how to organize whatever you're working on, but you can end up with a cool visual when your're done! It may not make sense to anyone else, but most importantly, it makes sense to you!</p>

			<h4>It's okay to mess up and start all over!</h4>
			<p>Sometimes, you realize you're doing something wrong.. And you need to start ALL OVER because you're so far down a chain reaction path that trying to go backwards and fix things will take even longer. While it's good to know that you CAN fix it. STOP. Leave the issue as is, and start clean and fresh. Keep your old work though. It's good to go back and figure out where you went wrong in the first place :)</p>
