			<h4>Experiment until you Understand</h4>
			<p>When you start learning to code, there is really no other way to figure out what a particularly html or css code will do until you experiment with it. Try all the variations and see what they do. The more you know how each works, the easier the next is to learn.</p>

			<p>Code, like babies, look like delicate complicated machines that you could break with the slightest error. But like babies, it's a lot harder to break than you think. So don't be intimidated or scared when you're experimenting. You probably won't break it and even if you do, you can often ctrl-z your mistake away. Don't you wish life had a ctrl-z option?</p>

			<h4>Take Deliberate Rest Breaks</h4>
			<p>When you're learning to code, you are learning something new. You've probably heard that we need 10,000 hours of deliberate practice to get good. But less well-known, from the same study, is that we need equally as much rest time to compliment that practice.</p>

			<p>So build rest into your learning routine. Now that's not a bottle of wine and a Netflix binge. What you need is deliberate rest. Rest that gives your brain a break and lets it process and connect all that new information you've just learned.</p>

			<p>Deliberate rest leaves you feeling refreshed and ready to learn more. It's taking a nap or a walk. It's reading a book on a completely different topic. Anything that feels like play, something you lose track of time doing, will help you learn better.</p>
