			<h4>I Wish Someone Had Told Me How Hard It Would Really Be Trying to Learn Something New So I Too Could Make A Living Wage.</h4>
			
			<p>I studied nursing, but had to quit because I couldn't afford to quit my job in order to finish the degree program I was in. The head of it actually told 200 of us in an orientation 2 years in we should quit and lean on our families to support us. What about those of us who have been supporting families since we were 13-years-old?!</p>
			<br>
			<p>I studied Biotech thereafter so my credits wouldn't go to waste, but I wasn't told until later that the starting pay for techs was half of what I make now. I couldn't afford to take the hit because my family would suffer if I took a degree related job and worked my way up for 2 to 5 years.</p>
			<br>
			<p>And in the last year, I've tried to explorer various different mediums of coding when I can fit it it in hopes of improving my life. See, unlike most new to code learners I work a full time job and have unrealistically extraordinary demands placed on me daily because I have an aging mother who hasn't worked in decades, a handicapped brother, and another brother who is a complete mooch. I'm struggling just to pay bills and focus most days. But no one cares. I'm just expected to perform like the old work horse I am, living to pay bills until I die. But no matter how hard I try, no matter how many hours I burn myself out trying to figure it all out, I never seem to make any ground. I just spend hours trying to learn a new skill, but a year later, there are others that are just going to be better and faster than me. It seems actually having a job is what is killing my ability to move forward - but I need the job because so many are depending on me and I'm not "allowed" to be a burden.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I wish now that instead of wasting thousands of dollars on worthless degrees, I had instead paid more attention to <em>Flashdance</em> and become a welder.</p>
			<br>
			<p>So my advice, accept that some people are just going to "get it" easier and faster than you are. And, even if you work hard, it doesn't mean your dreams are going to come true. Sometimes, life is just an ongoing nightmare of slave wages and hard work with nothing to show for it but debt and regret.</p>
