			<h4>Patience is your friend!</h4>
			<p>If you're brand new to coding, remember to be patient! You are essentially learning several new languages at once and it takes time to become skilled at each one. Allow yourself to be a student and don't get hung up on the fact that you don't know everything right now!</p>

			<p>Remember, there are a TON of amazing resources provided by Skillcrush if you get stuck. Utilize them! Don't be afradi to ask questions. It's how you learn and become a better coding genuis!</p>

			<h4>Roll with the process.</h4>
			<p>When you're first starting your blueprint, everything can seem overwhelming and might not make sense the first time around. Each lesson builds upon the one before it. If you're confused by the first lesson, give yourself the opportunity to go ahead to the next lesson and if things don't click, go back and practice or ask questions until you master the challenge!</p>

			<p>You are in this blueprint to LEARN and learning can be frustrating at times. Remind yourself WHY you're in the blueprint in the first place and push ahead even when things seem tough.</p>
