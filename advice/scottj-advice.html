			<h4>Skip The Theory</h4>
			<p>When I was in college, I made the mistake of spending too much time studying computer science theory and listening to professors go on and on about the deepest roots of programming. There is truly not a need to do that anymore.</p>
			<p>Unless you plan to be a computing/electrical engineer, try not to spend too much time worrying about processor timing, Assembly language, etc.  Try to focus on practical applications for coding, like the most popular languages and operating systems.</p><br>
			<h4>Learn As Many Languages As You Can</h4>
			<p>Don't restrict yourself to ONLY learning one or two languages.  Every coding language has an application somewhere in the world.  Some companies are STILL using Fortran and COBOL!</p>
			<p>Learning and mastering numerous languages will help make you more marketable as a coder, and also - it's really cool!</p><br>
