			<h4>Don't Be Afraid to Ask</h4>
			<p>At the beginning, you may think that you have to solve this all on your own. That is a definite no. Whether you ask classmates, fellow work mates, or even go as far as researching into Google, it will advance you in the long run. </p>

			<p>Sometimes projects, repositories, and coding can get frustrating or extremely confusing. In the end, the more you look into it, try, and keep asking when you need assistance, that's when you will succeed.</p>

			<h4>Don't Stress About It</h4>
			<p>You may think, try harder, harder, and harder. Yes, you do want to try hard, but do not overwhelm your mind. </p>

			<p>Stressing about every project you have will only make things more difficult and you will be feeling miserable. You've got to think positive, set goals, and take short breaks to make things balanced. </p>

			<p>You will understand this more once you get deeper into the process of technology and web development. Coding and Git can get a bit complicated but in the end, they're worth it!</p>
