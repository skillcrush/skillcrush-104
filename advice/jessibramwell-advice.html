			<h4>Don't just limit yourself to doing the classwork</h4>
			<p>Every moment you say to yourself "I wonder how that's done" is an opportunity to learn something valuable. The excitement is there; the drive to learn something. The resources are endless. Take every bit of that curiosity seriously and see it through. </p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Let go of the feeling that you are an imposter. </h4>
			<p>It holds you back more than you realize.</p>
