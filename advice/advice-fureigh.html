			<h4>Focus on what delivers most value.</h4>
      <p>Overpreparation has an opportunity cost. Better to identify a project that you want to work on and learn on an as-needed basis while working on it than to run through endless exercises.</p>

			<h4>Come for the code, stay for the community.</h4>
			<p>Learn at your own pace, sure, but you don&rsquo;t have to do everything on your own! There are plenty of opportunities to do meaningful work (and find co-conspirators) as a newbie, including <a href="http://openhatch.org">OpenHatch</a> and the <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/geeks/civicissues">Civic Tech Issue Finder</a>.</p>

      <h4>Always be coding.</h4>
      <p>&ldquo;A small daily task, if it be really daily, will beat the labours of a spasmodic Hercules.&rdquo; &mdash;Anthony Trollope</p>
      <p>Put differently: stay sharp.</p>

      <h4>Check out the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles">Government Digital Service&rsquo;s Design Principles</a>.</h4>
