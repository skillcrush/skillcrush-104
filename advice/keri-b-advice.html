			<h4>Keep Pushing Through</h4>
			<p>This whole thing can certainly get confusing, but keep on pushing through! It will all start to make sense the more you go through the lessons and practice. Sometimes moving ahead in the lessons as assigned instead of staying back on the same day can help to clear your head, and encourage you to solve what once stumped you.</p>

			<h4>If You're A Mommy Like Me...</h4>
				<p>Know that you can do this! Try to get the work done while the baby naps or during the first hour while he or she sleeps at night. Don't be discouraged when you miss days, take your time to catch up. You CAN do this so you can ultimately find a career that will allow you to be home with your babies. :)</p>
