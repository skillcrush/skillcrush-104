			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Sometimes, you just need to sleep on it.</h4>
			<p>If something comes up and you try and try to solve it, but don't have any luck....walk away.  Sometimes, either taking a break for a bit or sleeping on it and coming back to it the next day will make all the difference in world!!</p>
