			<h4>Don't worry if you're confused-I was too! </h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Take your time.</h4>
			<p> Don't let the progress of other deter you from your own goals! Some weeks the classes take me forever, and work gets in the way and I get discouraged. But, I remember that this is my own journey and I'm taking it at my own pace! </p>
