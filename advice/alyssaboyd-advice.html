		<h1>Alyssa's Top 5 Advice for Code Newbies!</h1>
	</header>

			<h2>5. Network, Network, NETWORK!!</h2>
      <p>Make friends. Connect with classmates. Talk to people who have the job you want/work in the field. Join Facebook groups, Tweet about your experiences, anything! Just put yourself out there!</p>

			<h2>4. Reviewing is your friend</h2>
      <p>It's not only good to review in order to keep the skills you've already learned fresh, it can also be a huge confidence booster!</p>
      <p>If I get really <strong>really</strong> stuck on something, I will go back and review things I've already mastered, not only to give myself a break, but also to remind myself that the things I've mastered were once really tough too!</p>

			<h2>3. Learning can come from different places</h2>
			<p>Find many different sources for learning. Different sources explain things in different ways, and sometimes a concept won't make sense in a webinar, but it will make total sense in a book! Finding information is a huge part of being a web developer.</p>
      <p>The sources that work for me come from all over the place: paid online classes, free online classes, books, websites, Youtube tutorials, apps, seminars, articles, documentation, friends, Facebook... It just comes down to finding sources that help you learn and understand.</p>

			<h2>2. Ask questions!</h2>
      <p>I'm not sure that it's possible to stress this enough. Even if you think the question you want to ask is dumb, ask anyway! If something doesn't make sense to you, chances are there are other people who also don't get it, and people who asked the same question in the past.</p>
      <p>One of my favorite parts about learning to code is how helpful and welcoming the community is. There are so many people out there willing to help you learn, so ask away!</p>

			<h2>1. Have fun!</h2>
      <p>This sounds really silly and people say it all the time, but it's true: if you're not loving what you're doing, you're going to have a harder time with it.</p>
      <p>Don't get me wrong, there is such a thing as a bad hour, day, week, topic, etc. Learning is frustrating at times, and you may second-guess yourself, but just step away. Clear your head and come back later. Being excited about learning and all the cool things you can do is the best part, and you should enjoy it!</p>
