			<h4>Google will become your best friend.</h4>
			<p>When you come across an error and you can't figure out what it means, Google it. There's a good chance
			someone else has had the same issue and will have a solution. </p>

			<h4>Try new Things</h4>
				<p> If you see something cool on another site, look at the source code and try to duplicate and put your own spin on it</p>

			<h4>Get Involved</h4>
			<p>There are plenty of organizations out there, both local and online. If you can't find a local group in your area, take charge and start one.</p>
