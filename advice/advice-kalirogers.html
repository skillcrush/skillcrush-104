			<h4>Baby Steps</h4>
			<p>On my very first website client, I took on more than I should have. I programmed it in html and css then turned it into a wordpress theme. It took me FOREVER! I look back now and feel like I should have taken smaller steps. Focused on learning one new skill with each project instead of diving into the deep end head first.</p>

			<h4>More time equals more practice</h4>
			<p>Time has been a valuable thing I have given myself. I took the wordpress blue print and then a year later took the front end developer blueprint. I think the time has allowed me to focus on what I like and what I want to learn next. I haven't been overwhelmed during the learning process becasue I have taken my time through each step. 

            <h4>Enjoy the process</h4>        
			<p>Everyone says that right! Ha. But for real, I have enjoyed learning something new and that is what keeps me coming back to coding. I love that there is alwasy something to learn.</p>
