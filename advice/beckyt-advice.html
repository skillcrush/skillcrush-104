			<h3>Ask For Help Early</h3>
			<p>When I first started, I was very hesitant to go to the google groups and ask for help. This made all the projects and issues take much longer to finish and resolve. Get help earlier so mistakes don't compound and make you feel overwhelmed and like you're never going to catch up.</p>
			<h3>Celebrate The Small Victories</h3>
			<p>Grad school taught me this lesson. When I am learning new things, it is really easy to feel like I'm constantly getting things wrong or not learning fast enough. I found that to fight off feeling discouraged, I just had to take it one step at a time and really notice and appreciate the things I got right. A bunch of small victories will eventually start to feel bigger.</p>
