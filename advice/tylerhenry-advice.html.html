			<h4>You will go insane garanteed(when you make a mistake)!</h4>
			<p>When you start your programming journey you have to somewhat go insane sometimes because you will make a mistake on your code and then figure out what went wrong only to find you forgot to add something or correct a spelling error.</p>

			<p>There are times when you will spend hours just trying to figure out what you are suppose to do by googling your options on how to tackle the task at hand only to find it to be a single lind of code to change the game.</p>

			<p>The road of coding and programming may be tough but there is a great sense of accomplishment when your code comes together and works the way you want it to work.</p>
