			<h4>Don't get discouraged!</h4>
			<p>Most things won't work on the first try! If they did, it wouldn't be a challenge.</p>

			<p>You will have to be a problem-solver. You will have to try out different solutions.</p>

			<h4>You don't have to have full understanding to make things happen.</h4>
			<p>Learn as you go. Whether you know how to do something or not, you can figure it out and you can do it.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
