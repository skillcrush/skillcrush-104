                <h4>Have something to hold you accountable</h4>
                <p>I've been trying to learn to code for over a year on my own, but I haven't lasted longer than a week or two consistently until I signed up for Skillcrush.  I hated paying for info I knew I could find for free, but if that's what it took to stay committed than I don't regret it.</p>
                
                <h4>Social Media is a huge motivator </h4>
                <p>Sign up for e-mail newsletters. Follow DHH and Skillcrush and Flatiron School, etc on Twitter for interesting and useful updates.  And fun updates.</p>
                
                <h4>An old school one: Visualization</h4>
                <p>Have an image in your head of what you want to be/do.  Daydream up project outlines and company pitches.  Imagine your kids waking up every morning to find you already digging deep into some code so they'll think you're as cool as Mr. Robot (check that out on USA if you haven't. So cool)</p>
                
                <h3>Dude, just dream big and work hard.</h3> <br><br>
                <p> Pro-tip: Don't do a factory reboot of your laptop mid-class. Merge nightmare </p> <br><br>
