			<h4>Keep Going</h4>
			<p>It's hard, but you can do it. Sometimes you will feel like you should give up. Don't. If you keep practicing, you will eventually become a coding ninja.</p>

			<p>There is more information here than you will know what to do with. You don't have to digest it all at once. Like coding itself, learning is an interative process.</p>

			<h4>Fit Code Into Your Life</h4>
			<p>Think about ways you can do things bettter. Often, you can do it better with code.</p>
			<p>Good night, and good luck.</p>
