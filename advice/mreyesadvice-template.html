			<h4>Taking classes twice really helps you retain the information.</h4>
			<p>The first time you take a class is an introduction to the concepts. The second time you take the class, the information and lessons sink in and make sense.</p>

			<h4>Follow the class schedule.</h4>
			<p>The best way to learn is to do each lesson on the day it's assigned. It makes the class work manageable and less stressful. </p>

			<h4>Practice what you have learned.
			<p>Practicing what you have learned will ensure you don't forget it.</p>
