			<h4>Have a snack box!</h4>
			<p>We need a <span>LOT</span> of brain food to get through these lessons. I had it handy to have a snack box right next to me to help me through the challenges.</p>

			<p>It's low key a dengerous idea because you would be eating all the time, but we need energy to learn something new!</p>
			<br>

			<h4>Reading articles and forums and checking the class slack reaffirms that everyone is figuring it out just like you</h4>
			<p>Ever think, man, am I the only one who doesn't get it? Or feel like "yikes" whenever you don't get it right the first time?</p>

			<p>As long as you keep hammering away and still try to look for answers, it's totally normal to feel like you <span>SHOULD</span> be getting it but you're not.</p>
