			<h4>Looks aren't everything.</h4>
			<p>Looking at code for the first time can be intimidating! It is easy to feel daunted when looking at a chunk of code and even easier to jump to the conclusion that you could never understand it- let alone create it. Just like in real life, looks can be deceiving. It really is easier than it looks and you WILL understand it in time.</p>

			<h4><del>Content</del> Consistency is king!</h4>
			<p>While "content is king" on the web, consistency is king in learning. Please don't fall victim to overwhelm and thoughts that you will never learn to code or know enough to be a pro. Commit to doing a small amount each day. Everything counts...Lesson by lesson, your learning will come together. In time you will be so proud of how far you have come!</p>

			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
