			<h4>It's never too late to learn</h4>
			<p>Even now as I have started my journey, sometimes I regret not starting to code sooner. But then I remind myself that it's
				better be late to the game than to never be in the game!</p>

			<h4>Surround yourselves with like-minded people</h4>
			<p>Don't hesitate to reach out and organize meetings with people in your area who have the same interest as you. Having a
				support system is very important!</p>
