			<h4>1. Take breaks!</h4>
			<p>When you are stuck with code that doesn't work and you've exhausted researching and experimenting, TAKE A BREAK. There have been many times I'm still bashing away at the code for hours until I finally just give up and go to bed at 1 am. Next morning I try again and figure it out in a matter of minutes. So if you are having trouble, take a walk, do something else, go to sleep and go back to the code with a fresh perspective.</p>

			<h4>2. Inspect Element is your friend</h4>
			<p>Use the Inspect Element / Developer tools to experiment and then save in your CSS. This will save lots of time.</p>

			<h4>3. Be patient and specific</h4>
			<p>Focusing on specific tasks will help you learn faster and more deeply. Have patience to research options and then experiment.</p>

			<h4>4. Pat yourself on the back</h4>
			<p>Make sure to acknowledge each new piece of code you get to work. Doesn't it feel good?</p>
