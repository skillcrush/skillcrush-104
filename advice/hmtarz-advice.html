			<h4>Be patient with yourself!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming, you might feel stupid or confused at first.  Do not let that feeling get you down!</p>

			<p>The truth is that with practice, patience, and persistance, you too will be able to master coding.  In the words of Elle Woods, "What, like it's hard?"</p>

			<h4>Precision, precision, precision</h4>
			<p>Your code is you speaking directly to the computer.  This powerful device will precisely execute your requests, but you have to word them CLEARLY.</p>

			<p>If you make a mistake in your code, the computer will not auto-correct it for you.  You have to go back and ensure that every step, every letter, is correct and accurate.</p>
