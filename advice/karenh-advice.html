			<h4>#1 Your Going to Think You Suck! ALL THE TIME</h4>
			<p>Its so exciting thinking about all the fun creative applications and sites you can code up. You see your favorite site and think wow I want to learn how to do that, so you seek a way to get educated.</p>

			<p>You begin to play around with basic code and think oh this is not so bad. Then you start connecting the dots and things seem a little iffy. Your other peers seem to pick up techniques faster than you and so doubt starts to wave its wittle hand. "Can I handle this?" you begin to question.</p>

			<p>Dont worry! This is all apart of the process. Doubt and fear are normal and feeling like you dont know enough is almost a requirement.</p>

			<p>So when you feel like you suck and arent sure you can code. I advise you to push through and challenge yourself and prove yourself wrong.</p>

			<p>Because next year when you are coding like a beast and snapping those if statements into place you are going to be one badass coder!</p>
