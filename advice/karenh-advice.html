			<h4>Anything is Possible</h4>
			<p>When I started this journey last year I doubted myself a lot. I think in a way it held me back. Once I decided that its all possible, my attitude and perspective changed. My best advice is to just keep going even when you feel a bit defeated.</p>

			<p>Dont worry! This is all apart of the process. Doubt and fear are normal and feeling like you dont know enough is to be expected.</p>

			<p>So when you feel like you suck and arent sure you can code. I advise you to push through and take a partner or Google to help you find resources.</p>

			<p>Because next year when you are coding like a beast and snapping those if statements into place you are going to be one badass coder!</p>
