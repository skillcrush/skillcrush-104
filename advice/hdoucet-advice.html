			<h4>Patience, humility, and a sense of humor!</h4>
			<p>This programming stuff is hard work, but it can also be incredibly rewarding.  The key lies within.</p>

			<p>Let's face it, some days the only thing working right will be all the error messages at the bottom of your screen.  And, it will be frustrating.  You will question why the code isn't working when you are SURE you did it right.  You will want to throw your computer across the rooom.  You will question your decision of ever being a programmer in the first place ("Gee, wouldn't I have made a better barista??")...</p>

			<h4>Don't give up!</h4>
			<p>Even though it may seem insurmountable at the time, take a step back and remember this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Take two long, soul-cleansing deep breaths with your eyes closed (REALLY).</li>
          <li>Take a break: walk around the block, the couch, do something that will help you to refocus your eyeballs from staring angrily (or hopelessly) at your defiant computer screen.</li>
          <li>Laugh.  Take a selfie and realize how ridiculous this whole coding thing really is!  And, be proud that you are at least TRYING to make this stuff work.</li>
        </ul>

			<p>I guarantee that once you shift your relentless focus, and you remember that you are HUMAN, that the solution WILL pop into your head.  Whether that solution is to phone a friend, search SlackOverflow, or dig deeper into the documentation, you WILL find an answer because you ARE smart enough.</p>

      <h4>Why Bother?</h4>
      <p>Because when it works, it is the most amazing and satisfying feeling... that will propel you right back into building more code because you CAN'T GET ENOUGH.</p>

			<p>And, that's where the patience comes in.  Rome was not built in a day.  Neither was the Internet.  Or Microsoft.  Or Apple.</p>
      <p>Many have gone before, and you should pat yourself on the back that you have come this far and have joined the masses of eye-strained, hopped-up-on-caffeine, overzealous, curious, and determined programmers.</p>
