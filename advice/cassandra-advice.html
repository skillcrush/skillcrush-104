			<h4><i>Keep going.</i></h4>
			<p>First and foremost, remind yourself of why you wanted to learn to code in the first place. Remember how excited you were to get started? Keep pushing through the tough moments, and you'll build up confidence over time.</p>

			<h4><i>Get a fresh perspective.</i></h4>
			<p>When you're feeling confused or frustrated, check out design and development websites for motivation. Keep a Pinterest board full of exciting designs or cool web projects to keep you excited about your learning journey.</p>

			<h4><i>Give yourself a deadline.</i></h4>
			<p>It can be hard to keep yourself on-track when there's no one demanding a finished project. Because of this, it can be helpful to pretend you're working for a client or other time-sensitive deadline to keep you delivering the goods.<p>

			<h4><i>Pencil in time away from the computer.</i></h4>
			<p>Sometimes it can be helpful to reflect on your project away from your desk. Grab some pens and paper and go for a walk (to another room, to a cafe, to a park) and jot down your ideas and reflections. This can help you reconnect with the overall goals for the project, and can even bring added insight.</p>
