			<h2>Keep going!!!</h2>
			<p>Learning something new is hard, no doubt about it. But, without struggle we never really learn anything, right?! So keep at it, even when you want to give up. Below is my new mantra that I have in a prominent place on my desk so that I can read it everyday.</p>

			<h4>You have to get moving-<br>
			Stop being a lazy ass-<br>
			Stop being a chicken-<br>
			Stop thinking you aren't good enough.<br>
			It's time to <strong>EXECUTE!</strong></h4>
