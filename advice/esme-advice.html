			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Believe in yourself</h4>
			<p>During your coding journey, don't be surprised if you keep doubting yourself. </p>

			<p>"I can't do this!" or "What am I doing?!"</p>

			<p>This is pretty normal. Coding isn't easy and at times it can make you feel like an idiot, but the key to succeeding is to persevere. Code everyday, even if you can only do it for five minutes. If you're stuck on a problem, it's ok to take a break and come back later. Just don't stop. And when you look back, you might be surprised at how far you've come.</p>
