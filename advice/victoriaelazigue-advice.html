			<h4>Frustration is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you first start learning code, you will realize that mistakes are very small and hard to find. You might get frustrated because you may feel like you can't seem to find what you are doing wrong. Getting frustrated is normal. Dont let that discourage you. Use your resources like Google groups and talk to your peers! They will be a big help!</p>

			<h4>You are not alone!</h4>
			<p>If you fall behind, don't feel like you're never to catch up and quit. Remember that the course is self paced and keep pushing forward. Coding bootcamp is a marathon not a race! If you dont give up, we will all eventually cross the finish line.</p>
