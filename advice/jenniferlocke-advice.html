            <h4 id="hard">Coding is hard...</h4>
            <p>But not as hard as you think. And sometimes harder than you think. Yes! I know that's confusing.
            </p>

            <p>That's because some things will come to you easily. And others will give you problems. It's those times when you want to remember <span>to use your resources</span>. If you have <span>books</span>, you can check those. <span>Cheat sheets</span>?
                Bingo! Also, <span>Google</span>! And an unlimited number of websites dedicated to coding and web development.
            </p>

            <h4>Sometimes the "why" and "how" isn't readily apparent.</h4>
            <p>If you're like me, you need to know the <span>reasons</span> for things before they make sense. And sometimes you'll have to look at the sample code to figure out the why and the how. It's okay. Be patient with yourself and use your resources.
