				<h4>It takes a village</h4>
				<ul id="village-list">
					<li>Most of the work and learning you do will be your own hard work, time, energy, money, etc.</li>
					<li>Don't fall into the trap that it's only you though.  It's your family, friends, neighbors, colleagues.  Everybody has a part in your journey.</li>
					<li>Don't be afraid or ashamed to ask for help.  <strong>There is no shame in receiving help, or not knowing something.</strong></li>
					<li>Don't be pig-headed.  Be humble.  Be grateful.  Remember that everybody around you helped you attain your success.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>The Power of Attraction</h4>
				<p>Like seeks like.  If you are positive, industrious, helpful, and kind; those same qualities from others will find you.<br/>
				Get rid of the negativity, the emotional vampires, the gossips, the jealous.  They don't have an intrest in your success.<br/></p>
				<p><em>Don't look back.  You aren't going that way.</em></p>
