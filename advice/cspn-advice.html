				<p>Let's face it, computers and technology are weird and scary. It's new territory and the map and the directions are written by those who build the machines and they cannot easily explain it to you because:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>They speak program and not english</li>
					<li>They prefer acronyms to words</li>
					<li>They assume knowledge not in evidence</li>
					<li>They believe delivery is all, documentation can wait.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>But that's no reason for you not to dip a toe in or just jump off a cliff and submerge yourself. Whether it's learning to build a website or figuring out how to fix a photo in Photoshop, come on in, the water is fine.</p>

				<h3>Put away your fears!</h3>
				<p>You're not going to break anything! At least not anything irreplaceable. This is not brain surgery and even if it was, as a newbie nobody is letting you practice on real brains. Besides, people more skilled and more experienced than you have been trying to break the internet and have not succeeded.</p>
				<p>So go ahead at try stuff and don't worry.</p>

			<div class="div-2 flex-item">
				<h3>Back! It! Up!</h3>
				<p>Because you're going to break something or delete something or change something and forget what you did.   In the end it really doesn't matter because you can always rebuild it. And who doesn't want a little extra practice?</p>
				<p>Or, if you were smart enough to back it up regularly, you can simply roll it back. Voila!</p>
			</div>
			<div class="div-3 flex-item">
				<h3>Validate!</h3>
				<p>You are going to have typos. There will always be missing or extra end tag or some kind of mishegosh that completely wrecks your beautiful plans and this is very important <span>YOU WILL NOT FIND IT</span>, at least without hours of mind numbing searching and testing. Often a code validator will show you where the error is, saving you countless hours and asprin.</p>
