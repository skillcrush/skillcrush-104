			<h2>Never stop fighting until you arrive at your destined place - that is, the unique you. Have an aim in life, continuously acquire knowledge, work hard, and have perseverance to realize the great life. </h2>
			<h5>  -- A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</h5>

			<h4>Starting out on my crazy coding journey!</h4>
			<p>When I first began my coding journey, I was actually at spot in my life where I had quit my job because I was so unhappy and truly wanted a change. I told myself that's it, I want to do something with my life that will bring out my creative yet critical thinking sides, but I wanted something that also made me excited to work. I wanted a step back from my engineering life and wanted to really look for that change I was exploring for, so I signed up for the Skillcrush Bootcamp Program.</p>

			<h4>What I've learned - Confusion IS your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

			<h4>Using online resources</h4>
			<p>The internet is a huge tool for us to use and learn about all sorts of things about programming! From using Google to ask questions, you can find a whole bunch of online resources for you to utilize. You can access tutorial videos from w3schools.com, ask questions from stackoverflow.com and you can also ask questions if you do not see yours preivously posted by another fellow user. But, of course there are plenty of other online resources out there, so make sure to do your research and get started!</p>

			<h4>Never, EVER Give Up!</h4>
			<p>The biggest take away I have had so far in my new coding world is to never give up. Trust me, I have had many times where I have become frustrated and want to give up, but that was when I told myself to just keep pushing. I think it really hit me that developing websites was exactly what I wanted to do and enjoyed so much was when I developed my first website in my Skillcrush HTML & CSS classes. I was in complete awe that something that seemed so complex was really broken down into very simple parts and pieces. Thus far, I have yet to look back and regret quitting my 9-5 standard, boring enineering desk job to a world wher I feel I can thrive in and where my possibilities are endless! :) </p>
