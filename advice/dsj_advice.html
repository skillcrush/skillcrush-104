		<h1>Hi! My name is Dave. <br />Here's my advice for new coders:</h1>

			<h4>Don't Take Mistakes Personally</h4>
			<p>Do you remember how many times you fell down when you were learning to walk?  A lot.  And it hurt.  That's probably why you don't remember it.  You blocked it away in your unconscious as a traumatic experience!</p>

			<p>Coding is easy compared to that!</p>

			<p>Somewhere along the line we learned that mistakes were bad.  Maybe frustrated teachers or over-achieving parents taught us to think mistakes were bad and they punished us for them.</p>

			<p>But, mistakes are how we learn. So, psssst!  Here's a really big secret: <br><span class="psst">Mistakes are okay, and everyone makes them!  Even great programmers!</span></p>

			<p>You're talking to a computer.  It has infinite patience.  So learn to have patience with yourself.  It's not yelling at you; it's confused by something you told it to do.  It's just less tolerant of logical ambiguity than you are.</p>

			<h4>Emulate Experienced Coders</h4>
			<p>The best coders have strategies for dealing with frustration.  Talk with a teacher or student you admire or even listen to podcasts where developers are interviewed.  Coding is mostly frustration punctuated by tiny bits of genius.  Learn how others handle that.</p>

			<h4>Do Physical Stuff Too</h4>

			<p>Programming can be intensly cerebral.  But you're a whole person, so get up often and remember to get physical exercise that balances your programming.</p>

			<p>Try a standing desk.  Sitting is the new smoking, and seated programming for hours on end can lead to all kinds of physical challenges.  So learn to work from various positions.</p>
