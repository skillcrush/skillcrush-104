			<h3>One Step @ A Time</h3>
			<p>The best advice I can offer to anyone is take this journey one step at a time. When I initially started studying front-end development, it seemed like such a daunting task. I'm the type of person that needs to see a glimpse of the bigger picture, which meant I needed to know the skill sets and order of study that I should follow to be successful. This made this new pursuit even more intimidating. </p>

			<p>Fortunately, Skillcrush, programs like it and online resources forced to focus on figuratively putting one foot in front of the other. Start with the core essentials and then proceed one layer at a time.  </p>
