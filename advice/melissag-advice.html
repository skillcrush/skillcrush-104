			<h2>It's never too late to start again</h2>
			<p>Even though I was obsessed with coding and design as a teenager, I took a 15-year gap before I realized that I wanted to pursue a career in front-end development.</p>

			<p>Now in my 30s, I thought it was too late to transition to tech and that I would never be able to catch up. But I was wrong! So, if you're in the same position and having the same thoughts, just know that it's NOT too late.</p>

			<h2>Skillcrush makes it easy!</h2>
			<p>Finding this program changed everything for me, and has given me the confidence to completely change careers.</p>

			<p>You just need to find a learning method that works best for you, and stick with it! Spend all of your free time practicing, learning, and practicing some more.</p>

			<p>Every new component that you learn and master will make you feel so accomplished, so stick with it!</p>
