			<h4>Double, Triple and Quadruple Check!</h4>
			<p> When your code doesn't work it can be extremely frustrating. And it's always due to user error. Inputing the correct commands and keys is ESSENTIAL</p>
			<p> hat is why it is SO IMPORTANT to make sure you've typed in what you really meant to type! I've often typed a comma when I meant to type a period. So the recheck helps you find those errors.</p>
			<h4>Cut Yourself Some Slack!</h4>
			<p>Good for you for learning something new! It's not easy! Don't get down on yourself if it doesn't come naturally or work the first time.</p>

			<p>I have found, when I hit a roadblock and start to become super frustrated, if I step away and do something else, I'm able to reboot my brain and fix it when I come back to it.</p>
