			<h4>Patience and Repetition are your main tools!</h4>
			<p>I love to work fast and have the luck of being able to retain things easily, but this whole journey has presented new challenges, because clearly my recall is based on easily recognizable patterns of language or symbols that I have years of experience viewing and recalling.</p>
			<p>I've made myself slow down and stop checking the percentage complete every 3 minutes so that I can truly absorb and understand all that we are learning.</p>

			<h4>I hate asking questions in a public forum!!</h4>
			<p>I much prefer to review materials and try many different options and check and check and check to try and solve my own errors.</p>

			<p>But Skillcrush is teaching me learning and retention skills.  The multiple learning type with which the material approach appeals to all of my learning capabilities.</p>

			<p>So in closing, my advice is take your time and learn what works for you.  You might find you are tickling parts of your brain that haven't been used to learn like this or function like this and that is pretty cool.  Enjoy the process.  Enjoy the method and Learn the HELL out of some tech shit.</p>
