			<h4>Don't be shy about posting on the google group.</h4>
			<p>I was really nervous to post anything on the group at first but it got easier when I realized how much seeing other people's solutions helped me find and correct the bugs in my own work and I wanted my work to do the same.</p>

			<p>It got a bit more challenging when I had to post that I was stuck.  I felt a little embarrased to post the code that wasn't working.  Looking through the lessons, though, it seems that lots of other students run into soemthing like that at some point and the instructors are incredibly helpful to give you a point in the right direction but they can only do that if they can see where you are running into problems.</p>

			<h4>Trust that it will make sense down the road.</h4>
			<p>For the most part, Skillcrush lessons are great about walking you step by step through each lesson.  So much so that sometimes I worried that I was typing what I was supposed to but didn't really master the concepts; like I was just going through the motions.  I learned not to worry about that until I had completed the entire challenge and ususly by that time it all made sense.  If it still doesn't make sense at the end of the challenge that is a great time to ask qustions on the group.</p>
