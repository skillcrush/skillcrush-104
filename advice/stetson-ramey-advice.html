			<h4>You're not going to be good right away</h4>
			<p>When I started, I was confused by everything (still am), but continue on, even if you don't understand something.  Forward progress will help you more than anything.  Don't beat yourself up about topics you haven't mastered, just keep learning more.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Don't spend as much time on things that don't interest you, more time on things that do</h4>
			<p>Topics that I find myself grinding to get through, I'll just try and grasp conceptually with a little practice.  Ones that I enjoy or have an aptitude for, I spend more time and effort on.  Keeps me enthusiastic about learning more.  Less struggle has worked well for me.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
