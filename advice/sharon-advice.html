			<h4>Google is your best frend!</h4>
			<p>The best advice I ever recieved was to think of Google as a Best Friend. Don't hesitate to ask (search) for help. It can be anything minor or huge.
			With the help of Google there is no end to learning but the key is to search by using right keywords.</p>

			<h4>Never Give Up</h4>
			<p>During the course there were multiple occations when I felt totally stuck and dissapointed. What kept me motivated was the google group. Knowing that I wasn't the only one facing the problems and reaching out to google group helped. When you think you are totally stuck, take a break. Go for a walk, watch a show, read a book or just sit and relax... but Never Give Up.</p>
