				"Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in." <br />~ Bill Bradley
			</h3>
			<h4>
				"Every path to success has been littered with doubt, fear, and uncertainty, as well as persistence, calculated risks and repeated action.
				The difference between someone who fails and someone who succeeds is the courage to act, repeatedly."
			</h4>
			<p>
				Now, this does not mean you will never fail. It is going to happen. You're going to have to work jobs that underpay and don't appreciate you.
				You're going to make clients upset because you can't meet their expectations. You're going to feel disconnected from your friends and family,
				your life, you may even loose yourself a little bit on your journey. Passion can be blinding and it can distract us from what's really important.
				When you have something you're passionate about, you're not going to want to stop working on it. You're definitely not going to want to admit that
				you might have been wrong, that your passion sent you down the wrong path.
			</p>
			<p>
				The most important piece of advice I can give you is to take a step back regularly. I know you want to move forward, sometimes it seems like that
				is the only way to achieve success. But the path to success is not a straight line, it's not paved with gold. The path to success is a woodsy jungle,
				 littered with landmines. It's going to take a lot of careful planning to make it through. That's where taking a few steps back come in handy. Don't
				 why you're on this journey in the first place. Take time every day to maintain your relationships, your health, and your sanity. After all, what good
				 is success if you've lost your mind, your health, and all your relationships? Write down the vision you have for your future. Write down what you need
				 to do every day to get there. Come back to this every day, add to it, change parts of it, scrap it all together if you need. What's important is that
				 you constantly evaluate what you're and where you want to go. And always remember,
			</p>
