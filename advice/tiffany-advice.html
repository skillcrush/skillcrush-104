			<h4>Things I Wish I'd Known</h4>
			<p>At first, I wanted to learn to code to see if it would be something that I could do. I was an English major, not a techie.
				I immediately found out what I had hoped: I loved to code.</p>
			<p>Learning to code meant big changes for me. I'd been trying to make a living as an adjunct writing instructor, but discovered that
					adjuncts aren't paid a living wage. I'd gone to grad school and all I got were some fancy letters after my name. I knew that I needed to find another way
					to make a living, but I had no idea how I could do that. Enter, <a href="http://skillcrush.com">Skillcrush</a>.</p>
			<p>I started with the <a href="https://skillcrush.com/skillcrush-10-day-bootcamp/">10-Day Bootcamp</a>, quickly followed by the <a href="http://skillcrush.com/blueprint/web-developer/">Web Developer Blueprint</a>. But midway through my Blueprint happened to be towards the end of my fall semester.
						I let class planning, grading papers, and driving to different campuses get in the way. I was exhausted. I'd get to coding later. </p>
			<p>Here we are, nine months later and I'm just finishing up my first Blueprint. When I started this crazy coding journey nine months ago, I should've made it a priority.
				I needed to schedule in the time to work on a lesson a day, not cram on the weekends. It's easy to let your current job take over. If I can give you one piece of advice, it's to prioritze your Blueprint. Set boundaries.
		Although it's taken me a long time to get here, I'm starting my journey as a developer. I wish I'd known it was going to be this fun.</p>
