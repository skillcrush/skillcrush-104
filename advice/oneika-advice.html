			<h4>There will be no sleep!</h4>
			<p>Studying with a baby in tow means nobody will get any sleep, ever. Never, ever.</p>

			<p>But learning to code and all about the interwebs is so fun and interesting that you will enjoy the process and miraculously get all your work done, you'll just be really, <span>really</span> tired.</p>

			<h4>Go outside!</h4>
			<p>When you're stuck inside all day you can really start to lose your mind.</p>

			<p>Hand the baby over to someone for 2 hours and take your laptop to a coffee shop. You will get some sunshine, hopefully a nice lunch, and most importantly - coffee!</p>

			<p>Some people may suggest having a nap if you can get a babysitter, but why nap when you can do some more learning?!!!!.</p>
