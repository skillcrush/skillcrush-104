			<h4>Google is your friend!</h4>
			<p>Whatever you're trying to do, it's highly likely that someone has done it before. Whatever problem you're having, someone has probably had it before. Don't reinvent the wheel. Google it! (Exception: reinventing the wheel can be useful as an exercise when you're learning. You're more likely to remember that wheels need to be round if you've tried a few square ones first!) Chances are you'll find a web page, blog post or forum reply that addresses a very similar problem to yours, if not the exact same one.
		</div>

		<div class="advice">
			<h4>Experiment, experiment, experiment.</h4>
			<p>The more different things you try, the more you'll learn. Don't worry that your experiment might not work. It's as important to learn what doesn't work as what does. Or you may find two different ways of doing something. Then you'll be able to pick the best one for a given situation.</p>
