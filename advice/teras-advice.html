            <h4>Don't be afraid to step away.</h4>
            <p>Sometimes you are in the zone and you want to keep working on the problem you are having, to get that div to sit just right or to make that section line up correctly; sometimes you need a break. Don't be afraid to pause and take some time out to think on the issue. It doesn't always help to sit for hours upon hours on the same problem when you aren't getting anywhere.</p>
            <h4>Don't give up.</h4>
            <p>When you are new to coding things can get pretty overwhelming very fast. I felt stuck and upset on my first week of a blueprint and I was thinking of quitting. Don't do it. Take a break if you need to, but do not quit. You'll get there on your own time and this isn't a race on who is done first. Relax and enjoy the learning process and when it's over and you've got that big project done, you'll thank youself that you stuck with it and you'll feel so darn proud of yourself!</p>
