			<h4>Frustration is common, but don't ever quit!</h4>
			<p class="first-para">Learning a new skill, like coding, is thrilling, but it can also be so confusing and frustrating at the same time.  The one thing you have to keep in mind is that this is completely normal and it happens to everyone.</p>
            
            <p>The one thing I have learned in my short time as a front end developer is that you are going to get confused as to why your code isnt working exactly the way you want it to and it can be wicked frustrating!! However, the most important thing is that you stick with it and don't ever quit until you figure out what the problem is.</p>
            
            <p>There have been times in my short career that I have spent hours working on the same problem, just trying to pinpoint one spot in the code that is causing all of the problems.  I am stubborn as all hell and don't quit ever, but sometimes you have to know when to walk away and clear your mind.  This really allows me to refocus and attack the problem once again with a fresh eye and new ideas.</p>
