			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before. Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening. This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process. You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

			<h4>Google It Up and Expand Your Library!</h4>
			<p>Have you had the experience where you're trying to write a piece of code that should be simple, I mean, it's something you learned in HTML&CSS, right? But for the life of you, you can't remember how to set the size of your hysterically funny GIF or how to change the background color of your page? Never fear...if you're having that problem, someone else did, too! Use Google! Buy Books! Create your own set of resources and don't be afraid to use it!</p>

			<h4>Patience is also your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you're learning to code, it may not come easily at first. It's easy to get frustrated. Sometimes you may want to give up. <strong>DON'T!!</strong></p>
