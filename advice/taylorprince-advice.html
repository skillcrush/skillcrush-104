               <h3>Confusion is your friend!</h3>
               <p>When you start coding your first website you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and you'll end up with something you HAND-MADE.</p>

               <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction.</p>

               <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
               <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

               <p>You are learning a new language. Be patient with yourself. Don't get frustrated if you don't understand it right away. Google is your FREIND.</p>
