			<h4>Be careful programming for the Web using Windows!</h4>
			<p>I have noticed on several occassions that some of the commands and techniques react differently when you use Windows</p>

			<p>The Mac seems to be less trouble because you are using Unix style commands.</p>

			<h4>Google can be your friend</h4>
			<p>I have asked questions in Google and I have found that most of the time others have experienced the same problem</p>

			<p>Usually there have already been solutions to the problems you are experiencing</p>

			<p>So don't get disheartend, just hone your troubleshooting skills and your will be Ok.</p>
