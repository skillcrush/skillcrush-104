			<h4>Take it slow</h4>
			<p>When you're new to coding, it's important for you to take your time and make sure you understand everything you're learning.</p>

			<p>Don't just follow the instructions, but try to understand why you're doing what you're doing, and how everything works.</p>

			<h4>It's ok to feel overwhelmed</h4>
			<p>You've entered a new universe of knowledge, and there's so much to learn. You're not expected to grasp everything immediately.</p>

			<p>Take an approach that works for you. This could be learning in small chunks, or embedding yourself into it for hours in a row.</p>

			<p>Above all, remember that you're not alone. There are plenty of helpful websites and forums where you can ask questions and get the answers you're looking for!</p>
