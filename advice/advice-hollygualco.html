			<h4>It's okay to feel like an idiot!</h4>
			<p>The fact that you are setting out to learn something new, and are wanting to take your career in a new direction already takes a lot of courage, so begin by giving yourself some credit.</p>

			<p>When was the last time you learned soething completely new?  It's hard to remember as an adult isn't it?  Therefore, those beginning moments of feeling like you 'just don't get it' or that coding may not be for you because it's challenging are totally disorienting, but they are SUPPOSED to be.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container-right">
			<h4>These things take time...</h4>
			<p>You begin by learning the 'how' and it takes time to fill in the 'why' and that's okay.  Just know that period of uncomfortability will pass and you will soon feel like you really have a handle on something new and invigorating.</p>

			<p>Pushing your limits and your comfort level outside the box to learn new languages and a totally different way of thinking is immensely brave, so keep coming back to that idea -- that you are so courageous to have started that you can't give up now!</p>

			<p>Know that once you push through that wall of understanding, you will make it to the other side with a completely valuable and adaptable new set of skills that are definitely in demand and so incredibly empowering.</p>
