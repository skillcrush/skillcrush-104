			<h4>Copy and paste is your friend!</h4>
			<p>We all think we are great at typing. We also think we are great at memorizing. Truth is, we are probably neither. That's what copy and paste is for! It doesn't make you look lazy, it just makes you look smart, consistent and someone who is determined to be accurate.</p>

			<h4>Always look at the source code.</h4>
			<p>If you see a web site with a clever design or program, see if you can look at the source code. If you can copy and paste that code locally, test it, tweak it and upload it locally, you have probably learned something quite valuable..</p>
