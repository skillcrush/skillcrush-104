			<h4>Failing isn't scary</h4>
			<p>Whatever you do, do NOT stop trying. I'm not where I want to be quite yet, but determination will get me there.</p>

			<h4>Do your research</h4>
			<p>Research every possibility, between which classes you take and which programs to use. Other people's opinions matter. And if it doesn't work for anyone else, chances are it won't work for you either.</p>
