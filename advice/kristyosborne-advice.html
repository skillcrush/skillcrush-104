			<h4>Buy a Mac!</h4>
			<p>While PC's are more commonly used than Mac products, in terms of web development, they are the industry standard. Even if you haven't used a Mac in a while and you aren't sure you'll be able to pick it back up quickly enough, it is worth the extra time you'll spend figuring it out.</p>

			<h4>If You Don't Know What You're Doing, It's Okay. Keep Trying</h4>
			<p>I have often felt lost and unorganized in my learning since I started studying web development. I feel like I am just seeing the tip of the iceberg on so many different topics and it can be frustrating when you feel like a beginner at everything and master at nothing. But it doesn't take long to figure out two key things: (1) Everyone else (even the masters) feel the same way and (2) Time and consistent practice will help you move out of beginner mode. There are so many free and low cost resources for learning skills online, if you are working on one and losing interest or you feel like your stuck, move on to a new one and come back to it later.</p>
