			<h4>Don't Reinvent The Wheel</h4>
			<p>There is very little that is truly new under the sun. When you encounter a challenge, assume that someone else has come up with a solution. Then, just find it.</p>

			<h4>Youtube Is A Great Search Engine</h4>
			<p>The other day I needed to take some good photos of chocolate for our artisan chocolate business. So, I searched Youtube for tutorials about food photography and voila - everything from lighting to composition and food styling!</p>

			<h4>When All Else Fails, Sleep On It</h4>
			<p>Often, when trying to solve a technical problem, I find myself going round in circles, getting nowhere. I sense that I may be making an assumption that is wrong. It's amazing how, the next morning, you can look at things from a new direction.</p>
