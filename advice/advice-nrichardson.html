			<h4>Attempt to achieve perfection</h4>
			<p>Your behavior and your life do not have to be perfect in order for you to be happy, yet this is an all too common misconception that many people share. You will wind up setting unattainable goals and your self-confidence will suffer for it.</p>

			<h4>Compare your life and yourself to others</h4>
			<p>This is not only one of the most common of the bad habits listed here, it is quite possibly the most destructive. We tend to compare our assets, our relationships, and our social acceptance with others. As a result, you create many negative feelings and thoughts.</p>

			<h4>Focus on life’s negative details</h4>
			<p>Dwelling on the negative aspects of your life and situation almost guarantees that you will be unhappy. Not only that but you drag down everyone around you in the process.</p>

			<h4>Get stuck in your past or thinking too much about the future</h4>
			<p>Reliving conflicts, missed opportunities, and painful memories can take a toll on you emotionally and mentally. You can also create nightmarish scenarios by spending too much time in the future and imagining how your health could fail or that your relationship will fall apart.</p>

			<h4>Limit your life by thinking that everyone/everything revolves around you</h4>
			<p>Thinking that the world revolves around you causes you hold back out of the fear of rejection. It scares you to think what people may say or think about you.</p>

			<h4>Live in an world of negativity</h4>
			<p>What we listen to and watch, what we read, and who we socialize with can have a negative or positive impact on our emotions and our thoughts. If you constantly expose yourself to negativity and let yourself get dragged down by it, it’s going to be extremely difficult for you to ever be happy in your life.</p>

			<h4>Overcomplicate your life</h4>
			<p>Life is complicated enough so why would you want to make it worse? This causes us to create stress and unhappiness while making the world more complex than what it already is. However, developing the right habits can simplify things a make your life easier.</p>

			<p>It’s important to note that happiness does not happen overnight. After all, it took years for you to grow unhappy and you can’t just erase that by flipping a switch or taking a magic pill. Just be sure that you set challenging yet realistic goals for yourself.</p>
