			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>The Google group and the teaching assistants are very helpful at Skillcrush. But for me, sometimes, a simple Google search may help more quickly solve the issues that I have on the challenges. There are a lot of resources on the web and it's still very scary thinking that I'm going at it alone, but hopefully, over time, I will feel more comfortable with finding trusted sources to provide answers that I need.</p><br />


			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
