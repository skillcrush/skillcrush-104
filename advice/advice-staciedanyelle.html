			<h4>Starting Out</h4>
			<p>When I was in college, I failed to pass into the core group of designers allowed to move on to upper level course work in the Design major. This crushed me. I thought I was doomed to never be successful as a designer. But a good friend gave me some important advice.</p>

			<p>She said "If it was easy, everyone would do it." and just like that, I was forced to suck it up and accept the failure. This small piece of advice led me to learn the value of perseverance, determination, and self-dicipline-all of which played a role in this journey as well.</p>

			<h4>Challenges and Moving Forward</h4>
			<p>Wrapping my mind around some of the already established concepts of working in code has been challenging. Coding is like a puzzle that is still being figured out. There is no single answer to the problem and that requires a unique way of thinking.</p>

			<p>Moving forward, I plan to continue to take on harder tasks with coding. I would like to challenge myself to combine my skills as a designer with my newly learned skills. I want to push the envelope on what I am trying to build and strive to go far with where I can take these ideas.</p>
