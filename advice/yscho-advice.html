			<h4>Jump In, Head First</h4>
			<p>Contrary to the warnings that you saw at the public swimming pool when you were a little kid, coding requires to jump in and not think about it too much. If you spend all your time reading books and not getting practical experience in a bash shell, then you need to join an online course like Skillcrush.</p>

			<h4>Start Now, and Not Later</h4>
			<p>When the tech sector regained its lustre after 2000 it was SaaS, the Cloud, mobile apps, and now truly web enabled technologies like Ruby on Rails, the MEAN stack, and the Full Stack. Cast your eyes over what you fancy and start now, not later. I initially was blinded by mobile apps but they're just an extension of the web experience. Start with the basics: choose the front-end, back-end or both.</p>
