	</div>

	<div id ="advice_one" class = "table">
	<h2>Make time for <i>happiness</i>!  :)</h2>
	<br>
	Do things that make you happy. Small or big. Eat that cookie, go on that hike, watch that movie, take that vacation! Just have fun, but be safe.
    </div>


	<div id ="advice_two" class = "table">
	<h2>Find something you <i>enjoy</i> doing. :D</h2>
	<br>
	Just imagine something you'd like to do and make it happen. Perhaps programming is one of those things! 
    </div>


    <div id ="advice_three" class = "table">
	<h2>Spend <i>time</i> alone & with others. ^_^</h2>
	<br>
	Time is too short to spend it all alone. Meeting new people is a great experience. Being with the ones you care about is also just as wonderful.
