			<h4>Random Advice</h4>
			<p>My first piece of advice is -- don't worry. You'll figure it out. Sometimes it helps to talk it out. Out loud. To another human. Away from the computer.</p>
			
			<p>Fake it til you make it. A lot of people don't like this advice, but I think it can be valuable. Have some confidence, and you'll rise to the occasion. If you don't have confidence in yourself, other people won't have confidence in you.</p>

			<h4>Six Stages of Debugging</h4>

				<li>That doesn't happen on my machine.</li>
				<li>That shouldn't happen.</li>
				<li>Why does that happen?</li>
				<li>Oh, I see.</li>
				<li>How did that ever work?</li>
			</ol>
