			<h4>Perfection is UNrealistic & UNnecessary</h4>
			<p>First and foremost, stop worrying about making it perfect. <q>Perfection is the enemy of progress</q> - make as many MVP's as you can and realize that everything you do is a work in progress, because it can always be better. And so can you. Remain curious and adaptable and hungry for knowledge. Be ready for change in the industry and in your project's deliverables. Enjoy the process of continued growth.</p>	

			<p>Be comfortable with discomfort. Life is in a constant flux and forever changing. You must learn to be comfortable with the discomfort of something new. Maybe even learn to love the unknown. You may not know the answer yet, but if you keep looking and working towards it, you will find it.</p>

			<h4>What would it look like if it was <span>easy</span>?</h4>
			<p>Figure out the simplest steps to accomplish your learning goals and then break them down into do-able chunks. Be a learn-it-all and ask the questions you want answered. This commmunity is there to help. Don't be afraid of looking stupid, because everyone was were you are once.</p>

			<p>And honestly, just Google it.</p>
