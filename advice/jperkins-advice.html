			<h3>&#9825; Patience Is A Virtue (that you will have to exercise often)!</h3>
			<p>Learning a new skill takes time and effort. If you have hung in there for this long then you definately have the drive to become a stellar programmer. So hang in there a little longer and take breaks often. Sometimes, when you feel like you just can't get it right, stepping away for a while and coming back with a fresh perspective (and a little more sleep) is all you need to keep going!</p>

			<h3>&#9825; Google is Your Friend</h3>
			<p>Are you just not getting something? Do you have an idea or maybe some code but something's just not working? Then maybe it's time to Google it! There is a wealth of information out there and chances are someone else has already asked your question or created a wiki on exactly what you're looking for. On that note, I personally spent a lot of time on Stack Overflow. It is a great website that has a ton of handy information but it never hurts to look else where, too! </p>

			<h3>&#9825; Be Kind To Yourself</h3>
			<p>Even the best had to start at the beginning so don't beat yourself up if things are not coming to you easily! If you are struggling I suggest rereading an article or replaying a video and jotting down notes to help you. Also, as I've said before, there is a wealth of information out there to help you get to where you want to go. Consider purchasing a book about the subject you are struggling with the most or download and app that covers tha basics like Rails cards or Lrn. Both are great supplements to the Skillcrush material. But more importatly remember that no matter where you are starting you are still learning and it is okay to mess up or ask a question!</p>
