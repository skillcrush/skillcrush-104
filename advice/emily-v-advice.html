		<h1>Hi my name is Emily and I have some advice for you!</h1>
	</header>

	<section>
		<div class="advice">
			<h4>Find
				<span>YOUR</span> focus time.</h4>
			<p>For me that means
				<span>Getting Up Early!! </span>When you have a busy schedule and are constatly pulled in multiple directions, find the time
				of day that you can best focus in and be productive.</p>

			<p>Since I've been waking up to do Skillcrush before I go to work in the mornings, my drive has skyrocketed since I actually
				feel accomplished when I sit down to work through lessons and projects. Find the time of day that works best for your
				schedule and energy flow!</p>

			<h4>Ignore the Haters and Negativity. Listen to your Gut and Stay Focused on your Goals.</h4>
			<p>Consider the advice of friends, loved ones and people experienced in the field, but don't let any negativity get in your
				way. Even if it's coming from someone you really care about.</p>

			<p>Remember your intention and goals, stay flexible, and just keep swimming!!</p>

			<p>Also, follow
				<a href="https://twitter.com/iamdevloper">I Am Developer</a> on Twitter. Funny and Witty account of a day in the life of a coder/programmer. (which I first came
				across in a Skillcrush forum :) )</p>
