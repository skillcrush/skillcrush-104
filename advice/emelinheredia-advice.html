			<h4>Don't give up!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming it's like learning a new language. At times it could be really difficult and seem like you have no idea what you are looking at, but after practice and dedication you grow a love for it.</p>

			<div class="two">
			<h4>Ask, ask, ask!!</h4>
			<p>With coding comes confusion, but you're never alone. Ask your fellow skill crushers for help when needed! Don't be afraid to ask a "dumb" question. It's better to know how to do something right then to get frustrated and not do it right!.</p>

			<div class="three">
