			<h4>Half of the Journey is Knowing Your Destination</h4>
			<p>When you start on a new path, it is a good idea to have a direction in mind.  It is easy to stay on the trail when your feet are pointed in the right direction.<br><br>

			Pretend your goal is a destination on a map.  Plot it out in your mind, as related to where you are now.  Figure out the shortest way to get there, and find the path of least resistance.  Know that they are not always the same.  Estimate the amount of time and work it will take to get from where you are to your goal.  Research as much as you can at this stage; hear others' stories in order to know that achieving this goal will truly make you happy.</p>

			<h4>Plot Your Course</h4>
			<p>Set up tasks and timelines.  Create benchmarks to see when you are ready to start on a new phase toward your goal.  Research in order to get a better idea of what obstacles to anticipate.  Clear your way:  eliminate any time or money-draining distractions.  Keep moving forward, even when feeling discouraged.  You will get there eventually, and it will be worth it!</p>
