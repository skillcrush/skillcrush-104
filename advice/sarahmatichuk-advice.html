			<h4>Keep moving forward even when it doesn't make sense.</h4>
			<p></p>

			<p>If you're feeling lost, remember that you don't have to understand everything right away. Experiment a little. Look at someone else's example. Try an answer you have found when googling.</p>
			<p>Now, you can try and understand why it worked and how you can make it better.</p>

			<h4>Don't be afraid to ask questions when you get stuck.</h4>
			<p>The answer might be something quite simple that you overlooked.</p>

			<h4>If you get really discouraged, go back and redo some things you've done before. </h4>

			<p>When you return to a previous problem, you will be surprised at how much you have learned since you first tried it. Things that were confusing will be clear now.</p>

			<p>Now, attack your current problem with some new confidence!</p>
