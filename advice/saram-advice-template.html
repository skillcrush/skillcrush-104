			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>The only way to truly learn and grow is to get lost. What seemed impposible before becomes rhytmic. The more you do it the easier it becomes. Suddenly you've found yourself on the otherside, you are found. </p>

			<p>Never give up. It's so easy to be frustrated when you don't see the solution but there is so many sources online and advice from counselors and peers. Don't be afraid to ask for help.</p>

			<h4>Deep Breathes</h4>
			<p>It's ok to step away for a moment. Relax clear your mind with something fun. A short distraction sometimes gives you clarity.</p>

			<p>You can do it!</p>

			<p>Remember why you started this new path. Remember there is always a light at the end.</p>
