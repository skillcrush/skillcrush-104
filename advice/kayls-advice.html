			<h4>Learn by doing!</h4>
			<p>When you first start coding it is normal to want to learn as much about the fundamentals as possible, especially if you are a perfectionist like myself. It is great to understand the basics of how things are supposed to work, however, trying to memorize template tags and HTML tags won't do you much good.</p>

			<p>The best way to learn is by getting your hands dirty. It not only allows you to get a feel for how each tag works, but it also allows you to make mistakes and learn from them. Your code won't be perfect and pretty right from the start. Even "experts" make mistakes. Plus, it's pretty cool to see what you can create on your own.</p>

			<h4>Don't compare yourself to others!</h4>
			<p>We're all guilty of doing this at one point or another. You see how quickly someone else is able to complete a project and how beautiful their end result is and think to yourself "I can't do that." :(</p>

			<p>The truth is, you probably can't accomplish a masterpiece like that...yet. Practice makes perfect and soon you will be able to complete projects you only dreamed of.</p>

			<p>Instead focus on your own journey. Think about it.. Once upon a time you didn't even know what a template tag was! Now look at you!</p>
