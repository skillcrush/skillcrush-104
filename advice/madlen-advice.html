<p>I don't feel qualified to give anyone
    advice but I am happy to tell you what works for me. I spent some
    time browsing through the <tt>advice.hmtl</tt> files of previous
    skillcrush participants and I learned a thing or two from some of
    the 408 submissions (as of Jan 17th, 2017). Did I read all of
    them? No, I didn't but I am a data
    scientist so I couldn't resist analyzing this treasure trove of
    data that Skillcrush provided here.</p>
  
			<h2>Be curious</h2>
			<p> I wrote an <tt>R</tt> and a
    <tt>Python</tt> script (<a href="https://github.com/mmwilmes/skillcrush105_data_analysis">available on github</a>) that provided the following insight:
    </p>
     
    <ul>
      <li>408 participants submitted the challenge</li>
      <li>7 (un)knowingly deleted the <tt>section</tt> tags that I used to
      analyze the text</li>
      <li>A whoping 88% (353 out of 401) participants changed the text in the
      document (i.e., gave advice). That tells us that Skillcrushers
      are in general really engaged learners! It is possible that some
      of the 48 participants that did not alter the text still
      changed the styling (which I did not analyze).</li>
      <li>A dog seems more than twice as important to learning how to code
      than a cat (dog mentioned 12, cat 6 times).</li>
    </ul>

     <p>
    Just for fun, I created a wordcloud of the <tt>advice.html</tt>
    files that were altered by learners. In a wordcloud, the size of
    the word represents the frequency of the word in the analyzed data
    set (N = 353). The most common word was "learning", which was mentioned 1112
    times. The outer (smallest) words had a frequency of
    two.

  differed from the text that was provided by the Skillcrush team.</figcaption>

    <h2> Learn from your peers</h2>

    <p>I mentioned above that I learned a lot from submissions
    of previous Skillcrushers (remember that I did not look at all of
    them). Here are some submissions I found inspiring in one way or
    another and I ruthlessly stole fonts, design ideas,
    navigation bars, etc...
