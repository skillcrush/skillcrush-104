			<h3>Do your homework</h3>
			<p>Make sure to <span class="bold">keep up with your assignments,</span> because if you get behind on your homework all the lessons start to feel really overwhelming.</p>

			<h3>Make time for it</h3>
			<p>Schedule 1-2 hours for homework every weekday, and <span class="bold">stick to it!</span></p>

			<h3>Give yourself a break</h3>
			<p>But also remember to take frequent breaks so you don't experience <span class="bold">information overload.</span></p>
