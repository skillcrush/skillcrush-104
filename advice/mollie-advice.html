			<h4>Find Comfort in the Discomfort.</h4>
			<p>After countless yoga classes where the instructor rattles off seemingly unattainable tips to find peace in a 5 minute-"chair pose", it isn't all for the physical results. By strengthening our mind to persevere through the difficulty, we are able to break through our mental limits and start to achieve more. The process of learning to code (especially without coming from a tech background) takes extreme patience, like holding a difficult posture. It takes a series of immersive experiences, filled with highs and lows. Laughing at yourself and knowing that everyone who codes has experienced the same learning curve, is the first step to finding peace in the process. Believe it or not, holding your "chair pose" was the easy part. Learning code is where the true test of mindfulness is found.</p>

			<p>How many times in your life do you get to be so utterly confused, learning a completely new (and valuable!) skill? Take this challenge as an opportunity to strengthen your mind and grow your portfolio.</p>

			<h4>Reach out to other people.</h4>
			<p>If tech is a new territory for you, don't be afraid to start talking to people. Tell friends and strangers what you're up to! It's a dark, nerdy world out there, full of amazing and talented people (just hidden behind the screen!). Bonding over coding is easy, because we all go through the same trials and tribulations. AND, even if none of your close friends are familiar with tech, it is without denial that we ALL use the internet. The web rules all, and you're learning the tools to make the world go round.</p>

			<p>There is no limit to who tech impacts. Find what gets you ticking, and relate it to web design/development or your tech path of choice. That's the beauty of learning to code. It truly IS for everyone!</p>

			<h4>It's never too late.</h4>
			<p>Yeah, you'll read it everywhere. It's never too late to <em>change your career</em>, to pursue what <em>you really want</em>, or heck, when to start <em>regularly applying face-sunscreen</em> (although, I would 100% turn back the clocks on this one). We can go through life with regrets, with a different order in which we "would have" done things, but being regretful isn't worth our time. Rather, use that time and energy to work towards the life that you really want! In my case-- I won't be tied to a cubicle. Instead, you'll find me freelancing. I want to design websites inspired by the most beautiful places in the world.
