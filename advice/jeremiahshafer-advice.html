			<h4>Know your learning style</h4>
			<p>Not all people learn just by reading, not all learn by watching videos, not all learn just by doing.</p>

			<p>I did a 3 month apprenticeship where all the learning was done by reading then doing exercises. This was not helpful at all. I learn more by watching videos.</p>

			<h4>Don't copy. Type out the code even if you are only copying.</h4>
			<p>Muscle memory is often helpful both as repetition and visualization. You will learn more by doing than copy and pasting.</p>
