			<h4>Stay in the Moment!</h4>
			<p>When you start this course, you may feel overwhelmed by the whole process - you're going to learn all these new skills and then actually expect someone to pay you for them??</p>

			<p>If you keep thinking about where it's all headed, it might all be too much.  You don't want to drop out and miss all those opportunities!</p>

			<p>So don't think about it until you are there.  By the time you get there, you will have what you need and the next step won't seem as huge as it does from here.</p>

			<p>When you start to freak out about actually being a <em>professional programmer</em> some day, take a deep breath, come back to the moment, and just write the next line.  'Cause' that's all you can do right now.</p>

			<h4>If It Scares You, Run Toward It</h4>
			<p>Fear has always played an important role for humans.  It helped them run away from big, scary predators.</p>

			<p>Fear of a future in coding - fear that you may not be good enough, that you may not make enough money, that you may fail - that kind of fear is also helpful.</p>

			<p>That kind of fear shows you where you are blocked.  So in order to grow as a person, it is important to run toward the fear instead of away from it.  When you wrestle through that fear, you teach yourself something profound about who you are and what you can really do.</p>
