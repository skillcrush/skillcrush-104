			<h4>You've got this!</h4>
			<p> Making sure your spelling skills are on point! And typing quickly is not always going to help you finish quickly! You need to take your time and close everything properly!</p>
			<p> Closing your tags properly can really help when you are making edits and keep refreshing your browser and see nothing! Also spelling your CSS properties correctly. align-items will definitely work- align-item will not </p>
			<p> Also try not to focus on perfection! Focus on getting done! This helps when you pull yourself away for a while and then go back to do updates and realize your true problem for reaching your goal was something you did not even realize! </p>
