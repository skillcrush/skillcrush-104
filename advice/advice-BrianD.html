			<h4>Learning to code takes time</h4>
			<p>When you start developing your first web page you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Learning to code, takes time. It's not something that you will pick up and be an expert at in a day or two.
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.
			You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
			<P> Just relax and take your time. Most importantly- <b>Practice!</b></p>
