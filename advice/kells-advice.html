			<h2>Keep Coding!</h2>
			<p>So, you love coding. You get involved in an awesome coding program, bootcamp, or project, and you are cruising along, loving your code and feeling super excited about all the things you've learned and are now implementing.</p>
			<p>Then, it happens. You get stuck. But not just stuck, REALLY stuck. You've googled, pinged your coding universe, and still no hope.</p>
			<p>What do you do now? You're frustrated, and tired of looking for the mysterious solution to whatever coding hole you've fallen into.
			<p>The best thing I've learned is no matter how frustrated you get, <span>don't stop coding!</span></p>
			<p>It's a common story to hear that fellow coders in their early days got stuck and ran away from coding for a few months. Don't let this happen to you! Even though you can feel hopeless, remember coding is hard, and don't let this defeat you!</p>
			<p>No matter what, don't stop coding. Put a comment in your code to note this tragic problem, and continue coding everything else in your project. This way, whenever you do come back to the coding abyss, it's the only thing you have left to fix. If you stop the project all together, you may come back one day (maybe months later!) not knowing how to pickup where you left off, so work to minimize that confusion and give yourself an easy spot to pickup from.</p>
			<p>Most importantly, never walk away from code. If you truly love it, you will succeed. Find a new function, a new chapter, another language -- <span>just keep learning, keep coding!</span></p>
