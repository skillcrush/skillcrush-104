			<h4>Betina Lynn</h4>
			<p>When you start programming you are likely entering a world and an
			industry that is completely foreign to anything you have undertaken before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is inevitable .</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>Trust the process. There will be many, many times when a new concept
			or process seems really difficult and no matter what you try, the result
		  isn't turning out the way you think it should.</p>

			<p>This is a normal. It is also normal to doubt yourself in this new
			world of coding and web development and wonder if you have what it takes
		  to be successful.</p>

			<p>Trust in yourself and keep moving forward. Remind yourself why
			you set out on this journey originally. Remember what you are working
		  towards. You will have breatkthroughs when things suddenly start
		  making sense where before it seemed like it was all gibberish.</p>
