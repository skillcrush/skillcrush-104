			<h4>Immerse yourself in code</h4>
			<p>At first, code is going to look really confusing, and it's not going to make much sense. Try to keep pushing through it and it will click for you - I promise! Don't just read it: use it, retype it, make the moving parts work (and not work) for you because that's how it will start to make sense.</p>

			<p>If the learning tool you're using isn't working for you, try another one. There are lots of ways to learn and another teacher's voice might help you get unstuck so you can come back with fresh eyes.</p>

			<h4>Look under the hood</h4>
			<p>Sometimes we want to just use the thing without understanding how it works. But if you're on this journey, you're going to get really comfortable with the idea that you CAN understand it, even if you don't yet. Just know that the answer is out there waiting to be pulled down from google.</p>

			<p>Once you have a basic grasp on one programming language, the next one is going to be quite a bit easier. Most languages are somewhat related.</p>

			<h4>Join the community</h4>
			<ul><li>Go on the forums like stack overflow and participate.</li>

			<li>Write a blog about your journey learning to code.</li>

			<li>Find someone else who's on a coding journey, and sit together and pair code.</li>
