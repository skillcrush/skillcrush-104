			<h4>You can do this!</h4>
			<p>Technology is intimidating, but if you ask for help, and take the time to learn- your hard work will be rewarded!</p>

			<p>Don't get bogged down in the titles and trying to memorize everything- trust that you can figure things out and don't be afraid to fail.</p>

			<h4>Have fun with it</h4>
			<p>Impress your friends with your new skills. Teach someone a cool trick- all of these things will help you feel confident with what you are learning. Plus- teaching someone else is often the best way to remember things!</p>

			<p>Challenge yourself, find a site you like and try to recreate parts of it. You won't get it perfect and it will take you a long time, but you will learn a lot in the process.</p>
