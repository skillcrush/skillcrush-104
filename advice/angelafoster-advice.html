			<h4>Confusion is your friend, or not!</h4>
			<p>Even though you have ongoing support, if possible, please try to keep up with the rest of the class. Having that "class" atmosphere helps out a lot when you can engage with the other class participants. This way, you don't feel like you're the only one in the class.</p>

			<p>Confusion? There will be lots of it. They say that it's a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits. But sometimes I wonder.</p>

			<h4>NEVER give up!</h4>
			<p>Let's say that life happens and you do get behind the rest of the class, Do Not Give Up! You are taking this class for a reason and just remember WHY you need to get through it and keep moving. You can always ask questions, it just won't be in a class environment, but hey, as long as you get some feedback, you're good.</p>
			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
