			<h4>Deepak Chopra learned how to use his "complete brain."</h4>
			<p>Chopra, the renowned leadership guru, adopted a new worldview from psychiatrist Dr. Dan Siegel. Siegel saw the brain as a tool that needs daily upkeep, and prescribed a "healthy mind platter" of sleep time, physical time, focus time, time in (self-reflection), down time, play time, and — most importantly — connecting time.</p>

			<h4>Angela Ahrendts learned as a child to always stay true to yourself.</h4>
			<p>Ahrendts, CEO of Burberry and incoming Apple retail chief, spent a lot of time as a teenager in her father's office. He had the poem "Desiderata" by Max Ehrman framed on his wall, and she memorized it out of boredom. Years later, the poem's message of staying true to oneself set in. </p>

			<h4>T. Boone Pickens' dad taught him the importance of having a plan.</h4>
			<p>Pickens, chairman and CEO of BP Capital and TBP Investments Management, got a harsh dose of reality from his dad when he was in college. Pickens' father thought his son was drifting aimlessly and told him: "A fool with a plan can outsmart a genius with no plan any day." Pickens soon declared a new major and said he's had a plan ever since.</p>

			<h4>Arianna Huffington's mom taught her that she is always in control of her own actions.</h4>
			<p>Huffington, president and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post Media Group, always got the same advice from her mother when she felt hopeless. Her mom likened facing adversity to watching a horror film on TV: "Darling, just change the channel. You are in control of the clicker. Don’t replay the bad, scary movie."</p>
