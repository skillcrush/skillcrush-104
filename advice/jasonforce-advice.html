			<h4>Finish What You Start!</h4>
			<p>This may seem obvious to some, but I have made this 
			mistake so many times.  I've started a tutorial or online 
			class just to get frustrated, bored, or busy and quit.  This 
			horrible for learning.  You find yourself relearning things 
			you already know and it ends up taking you so much longer to 
			progress than it would have if you just finish what you start.</p>
			
			<h4>It's going to take A LOT of your time!</h4>
			<p>Learning a new set of skills as comlicated as coding is 
			going to take a long time.  If you don't want it to take you 
			years and years and years, you're going to have to put a lot 
			of your free time into learning and practicing.  I take about 
			an hour a day at work (we're allotted an hour a day for 
			professional development) first thing in the morning and my 
			lunch hour to learn and practice.  On the weekends, I have 
			been using almost my entire days to learn and practice.</p>
			
			<h4>Get the support you need.</h4>
			<p>My wife has been great!  She's really been picking up my 
			slack around the house with house work and the kids so I 
			can have time to work on learning.  Of course, she's hoping 
			it will pay off in the form of a high-paying job for me
			so that she can be a stay at home mom....I'm hoping for that 
			too.</p>
