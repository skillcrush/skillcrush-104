			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>I would say that my most important piece of advice for anyone who wishes to learn to code is to P R A C T I C E !!!!!! The best way to do this is to dive in head-first, make mistakes, ruin your nice design to learn how to put it back together again. While it is frustrating, it makes problem-solving much less daunting (and much more fun(.</p?)



			<h4>Attention to detail while maintaining reckless abandon builds confidence in coding while making troubleshooting efficient as possible.</h4>
