			<h4>Confusion is your friend...</h4>
			<p>I highly suggest using Google ALL the time as an additonal resource. This course is a very high level overview and does not go in-depth.</p>

			<h4>Frustration is normal.</h4>
			<p>If you are not frustrated you probably aren't being challenged. I have found that although this course is a good high level overview, it is not the end all to learning to code. <br>
				Coding is learning a new language and there are many ways to learn, the best usually involve full immersion. So immerse yourself! </p>
