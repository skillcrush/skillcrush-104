			<h4>Failing can be the best thing to happen</h4>
			<p>In the last 2 months since starting this Blueprint I have gotten used to failing and getting confused in certain projects.  However, it is the best thing that has happened for me.  I have been able to play around with code and figure out what works and what doesnt.</p>

			<p>I truly believe that failing and getting confused teaches the problem solving skills needed for tech.</p>

			<h4>What to do when you just can't anymore?</h4>
			<p>Sometimes you just can't look at your code and computer screen anymore.  Everything, looks the same and you're just down right annoyed.  I have found that taking a break, even a full day of rest away from what you have been working on, can help you refresh.</p>

			<p>It's truly amazing to see how fast you can fix a bug, when you give yourself some space to regroup.</p>
