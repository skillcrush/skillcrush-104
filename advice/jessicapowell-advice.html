			<h4>Tell a friend how much school you're going to do today. </h4>
			<p> If you're like me, let's be real. You have fallen behind on classes at one point or another. Catching up goes really well when you have a goal set in accountability. Ask a friend you know will ask you how far you got.</p>

			<h4>Put on some music that will help you focus.</h4>
			<p> I've always been able to zone out of everything else and just work when I've got the score to the Fellowship of the Ring playing in my headphones. Admittedly it's a geeky thing, but it works for me every time.</p>

			<h4>Write down your to-dos and what's worrying you.</h4>
			<p> We've all had those things rattling in our head: picking up that thing from the grocery store, the relationship problems distracting us from our best work. Write it down and relax knowing you'll be able to mentally pick up where you left off when you are done doing what you really want to be doing. Stay productive, and don't let your own self be the one that keeps you from this next chapter in life.</p>

			<h4>Set a timer. </h4>
			<p> Set your timer to work on your classes for less than what you think it will take. Now that you're set up to focus, you can use the pressure of the timer to keep you on task. If you're working a job plus your Skillcrush classes and taking care of your household, you just don't have time to waste. If you're working before bed, this will get you to bed on time. You need your sleep!</p>

			<h4>Change the scenery.</h4>
			<p> Now that you've got a timer, use those break times to move somewhere else. I prefer my coffee to coffee shop brew, so I go to the public library and enjoy the calm working environment there. I created a workspace in my room just for learning Skillcrush classes, so it's a sacred space which helps me focus. </p>

			<h4>Resolve to be satisfied in your work. </h4>
			<p> As the addage goes, done is better than perfect. You did SOMETHING today, and that's worth feeling satisfied in yourself. Set your goals for next time and rinse and repeat this list as needed!</p>
