			<h4>Take some breaks.</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>So don't overload yourself. The best think you can do is sleep on what you've learned and see how much you've retained the next day. Let it marinate overnight, you know?</p><br>

			<h4>Don't take too many breaks.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>Step away for a breather.  Go for a walk.  Watch a comedy.  But don't let frustration or anxiety delay you for too long or you may end up taking steps back for each step forward.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p><br>
