			<h4>Don't give up!</h4>
			<p>Learning new things can be tough.  I found that I breezed through HTML and CSS, but almost gave up my dream of web development when I got into JS.</p>
			<p>I learned that it is okay to walk away or focus on something else for a little while.</p>
			<p>Moving on to Ruby before I finished JS was very helpful for me.  I am now able to return to JS with a better understanding of OOP.</p>
