			<h4>It's not easy, but don't give up!</h4>
			<p>When I first joined skillcrush I thought that I would be able to learn all of these skills in around 3 months.
				I told myself "Sure! That sounds awesome! I can do it and be headed out to start working in a few months!" <br><br>
				Ummmm, no... <br><br>
				Maybe for the average tech savvy computer person with an average brain it works out this way. You might find it all super easy and fly right through it! Good for you!
				For me not so much.. I have continuously struggled every step of the way.<br> It has been challenging, frustrating and has even made me shed a few tears over the course of the program.
				I have learning disabillities and a head injury, and while I refuse to let that stop me, it has definitly played it's part in holding me back.<br> I've had to re-start twice now and two classes have passed me by and finished.<br>
				But you know what? <strong>That's ok!</strong> Everyone learns at a different pace and with different styles of learning.<br>
				You have to be ok with the idea that you may not finish with the rest of the class. It might take you longer and it will probably be frustrating at times.. but it's worth it and you can do it!<br>
				Please be kind to yourself and don't get hung up on falling behind or struggling along at a slower pace.<br>
				<br>If it takes longer, it takes longer! Don't stress over timelines!<br>
				<br>If you need a lot of help, ask for it!!<br>
				<br>And sometimes skipping something for a while is ok, as long as you go back to it and try again!<br>
				<br>You can do this!!
				</p>


			<h4>Breaks are important!</h4>
			<p>Another important thing to remember is to take breaks.<br>
				I learned the hard way what sitting around all day staring at a screen can do to your body and mind.<br>
				Making sure to get enough exercise is super important, especially if your body isn't used to desk type work.<br>
				I hurt my back pretty badly and had a long recovery from trying to cram and by not paying enough attention to what my body needed.<br>
				If you have problems with sitting all day try new things out! I bought an exercize ball to sit on and also built a standing desk out of binders and cardboard. It helped a lot!
				You also don't have to rush out and spend a tonne of money. Try things out first and see if they work! <br><br><strong>Movement is good!</strong><br><br>
				Mental breaks are also very important. A good idea is to set an alarm to go off every hour or two and to take at least a 5 min break away from the computer.
				Go for a little walk, do some stretches or have a snack. I found I was getting headaches from working for 8 hours or longer straight without taking any breaks. Not cool!<br>
				Making sure to get some fresh air and sunlight occasionally is really helpful!<br>
				Take care of yourself and build healthy habits from the beginning, and you won't have to suffer later!<br><br><br>

				I hope some of these suggestions help you out! Good luck and have fun on your journey!<br><br>
				Wishing you all the best, Natalie
