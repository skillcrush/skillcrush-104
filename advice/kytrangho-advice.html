		<h1>Hi my name is Ky Trang Ho and I have some advice for you!</h1>
	</header>
<h4>Here are six hacks I've learned from various people to optimize your learning and productivity.</h4>
	<section>
		<div class="advice">
		<ol>
			<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/home/welcome" target="_blank">Take "Learning How to Learn" by Coursera</a></li>
			<p>This class was recommended to me by a someone in the LA Coders Facebook group. It teaches valuable learning skills based on how the brain works in a very entertaining and light-hearted manner.</p>
			<li><a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/regular-exercise-changes-brain-improve-memory-thinking-skills-201404097110" target="_blank"> Excercise </a></li>
			<p>Excercise is one of the most effective means of improving your physical, mental and emotional health. You need to do it every day just like eating and sleeping. Exercise relieves stress, improves mood, boosts memory among myriad other benefits. As you'll see from "Learning How to Learn," excercise lets your brain operate in the diffuse mode, which is essential to learning.</p>
			<li><a href="http://eocinstitute.org/meditation/meditation-will-increase-your-capacity-for-learning/" target=_"blank">Meditate</a></li>
			<p>Meditate for least 10 minutes every morning when you wake up. Meditation is also productive during the day. I recommend not meditating before bedtime because meditation puts your brain in a relaxed state and may make it hard for you to fall asleep because your brain thinks it already had sleep. Meditation increases Alpha brainwaves, essential for learning and memory.</p>
			<li><a href="http://www.lifehack.org/371544/these-6-amazing-things-will-happen-you-read-before-bed-2 target="_blank">Read</a></li>
			<p>Read for at least one hour before bed but only in paper -- not digital versions. The light from digital devices will hinder good sleep because it makes your brain think its daytime. Reading before bed improves creativity, concentration, sleep and empathy and lowers stress.</p>
			<li><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbradberry/2016/09/13/4-reasons-sleeping-naked-makes-you-healthier-and-wealthier/#2c8d88e01c2d" target="_blank">Sleep Naked</a></li>
			<p>Good sleep is paramount to mental health. "Lowering your skin temperature increases the depth of your sleep and reduces the number of times you wake up in the night. Stripping down to your birthday suit is a great way to lower your skin temperature without changing the temperature of the room."</p>
			<li><a>It's OK to hate <strong>Git!</strong></a></li>
			<p>Git is about as fun as watching dogs eat their own shit -- especially the white kind from the 1970s. After Git mentally tortures you, you'll find an abundance of user-friendly alternatives to the command line such as GitKraken and Sourcetree.</p>
