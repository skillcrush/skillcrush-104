			<h4>Be Patient!</h4>
			<p>Don't feel the need to know everything immediately. Web development is an endless process of learning; that's a good thing! Be kind to yourself and do check-in's so that you can see how far you've come during your journey.</p>
            
            <h4>Be Curious!</h4>
            <p> Use all the resources available to you. Listen to podcasts like Code Newbie and Learn to Code With Me. Check out the endless opportunities in technology. Read current technology news. </p>
            
            <h4>Have Fun!</h4>
            <p>Sure, coding can be frustrating. It can also be exhilarating when you figure out a coding challenge you've been working on for hours. Make websites that you enjoy looking at. Create apps just for fun even if they don't serve some grand purpose. Enjoy this process of learning. </p>
            
            <h4>Find Your Community</h4>
            <p>Obviously Skillcrush is an amazing one. :) Join local meetups as well!</p>
