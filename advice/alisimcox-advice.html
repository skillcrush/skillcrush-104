			<h4>Step one: breathe a sigh of relief, because you don't have to know everything!</h4>
			<p>To be a successful programmer, you don't have to be a walking database, or someone with a photographic memory, or Mark Zuckerberg. You just have to commit to a generous application of curiosity and persistence.</p>

			<p><strong>Not sure what code to use?</strong> <em>Google it</em>.</p>
			<p><strong>Not sure why your html file isn't displaying correctly in a browser?</strong> <em>Start digging through your code for clues.</em></p>
			<p><strong>Don't know how to use a new tool that just became available?</strong> <em>Ask your fellow coders in an online community.</em></p>
			<p>The point is, a programming language is not so much a finite body of knowledge to be mastered as a set of guidlines to become familiar with while maintaining an attitude of "I can figure this out."</p>
