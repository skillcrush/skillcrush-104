			<h1>Don't be afraid to make mistakes!</h4>
			<p>It's ok to make mistakes. It's necessary to make mistakes. You don't learn unless you keep making mistakes.</p>

			<p>Ask questions, ask them often, ask them before you feel comfortable.</p>

			<h4>Be kind to yourself.</h4>
			<p>You are not going to become a master of anything, ever. You'll get better and better, but you're going to find that things don't work as you expect them to. And that doesn't mean that you are not worth anything.</p>
