			<h4>Get frustrated, but don't let it consume you!</h4>
			<p>Its ok if you get frustrated! Use the forumn and talk to everyone. They are going through the same learning expereince that you are and it's good to make some friends.</p>

			<h4>Sign up, get involved, connect, connect, connect</h4>
			<p>Listen to podcasts and check out a other website. Its great to see different people's percption on coding.</p>

			<p>I started a twitter account sort of late in the game.  I still don't update it enough.  Maybe I'm afraid my new tech connections will laugh at me? I don't know.  I DO KNOW that everyone has been newb status before.  Don't be shy!</p>
