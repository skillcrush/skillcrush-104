			<h4>Schedule chunks of time</h4>
			<p>In order to take full advantage of the Skillcrush courses when working a full-time job, I recommend setting aside large chunks of time to really devote yourself to it and let the lessons sink in.
				For me, I've sat at Starbucks for a few hours on Saturdays to accomplish the week's work.</p>
			<h4>Don't beat yourself up if you fall behind</h4>
			<p>Life happens. That doesn't mean you aren't committed or that you aren't getting into the course. Just pick up where you left off and keep going.
				The important thing is to keep making progress, one step at a time.</p>
