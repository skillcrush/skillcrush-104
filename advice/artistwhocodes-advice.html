            <h4>Cut and Paste</h4>
            <p>A learning technique that has got me to learn to code was going into a file and basically, mess with it. For example, reading a style.css file is a perfect way to learn how to code in CSS. I would cut out chunks of code to see what effect it had on the website. I did this before I knew how to code or (I guess) the inspect tool was around for browsers. Looking through a code and experimenting with it. Such as breaking it apart and putting it back together was and still is a great way for me to learn how a code function. To realize and to see for yourself what it does, made it fun for me and understandable. If you’re a visual learner, you should definitely give it go! If you’re not a visual learner, well still give it a go. It doesn’t hurt to try. </p>

			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p class="pink">When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p class="pink">Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p class="pink">When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p class="pink">This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p class="pink">You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
