			<h4>Schedule time in your day!</h4>
			<p>Juggling a full time job and life is difficult enough without having to balance Skillcrush class on top of it all. It is important to set aside time to focus on classes so you don't fall behind!</p>

			<p>Remember that these classes are designed to help you expand your horizons and better yourself. Setting aside an hour each day is the least you deserve in order to keep growing your professional skillset!</p>

			<h4>Don't worry about the roadblocks.</h4>
			<p>No matter what your set of skills are, you will run into roadblocks and challenges along the way on your tech journey. Make sure to keep your head up and try again!</p>

			<p>It is okay to be frustrated with the issues at hand, but don't let that discourage you! Take a break and come back with a fresh perspective and troubleshooting alternatives.</p>

			<p>Try searching through the Skillcrush Google group-- you are definitely not the only person having these issues! Or you can always reach out to a Skillcrush instructor. Remember the internet is your friend and tons of information about technology is out there to help you get out of the rut!</p>
