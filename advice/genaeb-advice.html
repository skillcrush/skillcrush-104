			<h4>Step out of your comfort zone!</h4>
			<p>There does come a time when you want to see something different, do something different, experience something different. We've all been there, but then fear tries to tell us it's better to stay where we are; at least where we are is someplace we are used to.  </p>

			<p>But, stepping out of that comfortable, cozy spot helps us to grow. To learn things about ourselves that we may not have realized. At least this has happened to me. Once I decided to actually do something different instead of just thinking about it, things started to change. My perspective started to change. We discover we are stronger then we thought, smarter than we imagined. We are capable of so many things, if only we try.</p>

			<h4>Learn Something New!</h4>
			<p>Specifically, discovering technology and wanting to learn so much more about it has really pushed me into thinking about things differently. It has allowed me to push myself and discover new talents and gifts. It opens up the need to solve problems and allows you to be creative while doing it. Start off discovering the ways in which technology can help others. That has been a great motivator. Then start incorporting the many different coding languages into your daily study. There is alot to learn, but mastering at least one of them is more than you knew in that cozy comfort zone. And connect with others who are attempting to learn the same things so you don't feel alone.</p>

			<p>Finally, don't be afraid to fail. It's when we fail, that we learn what not to do in order to succeed the next time. This is what seems to have helped me grow the most. When I get something wrong, it's that lesson that seems to stick with me the most. And what can really go wrong? Well, technically things can, but there are so many different ways to solve a problem with code. If you don't succeed the first time, try a different language.</p>

			<p> And always, keep learning, keep growing, keep pushing.</p>
