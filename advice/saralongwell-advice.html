			<p>
               <ol>
                   <li>Don't hesitate to ask questions whenever you need to, in the Google group, during office hours, anywhere!</li>
                   <li>Use outside educational resources. If you don't understand a concept the way it's being explained here, go find someone else's explanation and search until you find something that makes it make sense to you.</li>
                   <li>If you get stuck and suddenly feel in over your head, go back to the last lesson where everything made sense and work your way through each step, not proceeding until you fully understand each concept.</li>
                   <li>Keep your big picture motivation in your mind at all times. Don't lose sight of what motivated you to start this journey in the first place.</li>
                   <li>Jump in! Just start trying your own projects as soon as you can. It's the best way to build skill and confidence.</li>
               </ol>
