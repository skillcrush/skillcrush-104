				<h3>You, yes YOU can code! </h3>
				<p>Learning a complicated new thing like coding can be incredibly daunting. Like, climbing Mt. Everest during a blizzard daunting.</p>

				<p>You may be just starting your career or switching into a new one. Your friends / family members / strangers on the street may say, "You're going into Tech? Isn't that for really smart computer geeks who work at big companies in Silicon Valley? You went to Art School!"</p>
				<p>Fear not! You can learn to do this! It takes dedication, drive and curiosity. All of which I know you have or you wouldn't be here, right? Oh, and caffeine...lots of caffeine.</p>
				<p>Now that we got that out of the way...</p>

			<div class="tip">
				<h3>Ask for help when you are stuck.</h3>
				<p>Let's face it, you're not going to know it ALL right away! Leaning on those who have come before you is not a weakness. People in this community love to help and share their knowledge.</p>
				<p>Check out the Skillcrush Forums often to ask questions, troubleshoot problems and help out your fellow peers. We're all in this together, so tap into your online community as much as you can.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="tip">
				<h3>Get INSPIRED!</h3>
				<p>Every day, find one thing that inspires you and save it somewhere that you can find it again. Found a really beautifully designed website with killer UI/UX? Bookmark it! Love a fashion blogger's Instagram style? Follow them! But don't stick to just the interwebs...</p>
				<p>Go outside and look at your natural surroundings. Those newly fallen leaves on the ground, or the peeling paint on an abandoned building could be the Color Scheme for your next website. Photograph it! Just find something that inspires you to create, because coders should DESIGN too!</p>

				<h3>Above all else... Don't. Give. Up.</h3>
				<p class="important">Happy Coding!</p>
