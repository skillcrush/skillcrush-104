			<h4>Learning To Code!</h4>
			<p>When you're first learning to code it can be very overwhelming and frustrating. It's a whole new language you're learning, so it is very foreign to what you're used to.</p>

			<p>It's a good sign when it's overwhelming and frustrating because that means you're learning and challenging  yourself. It if were easy it wouldn't be rewarding. Once you do master and figure out what you're doing in coding, it's a very rewarding experience because you get to create nothing into something.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
