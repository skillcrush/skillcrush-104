			<h4>Just get started!</h4>
			<p>Skillcrush is a killer tool, but it's up to you to put in the work! Don't let frustration stop you. This is gonna get hard. When you hit a roadblock, just pivot and keep going.</p>

			<p>Do what you need to do to continue to move forward. Review your goals and reconnect with your "why" - why did you start on this path to begin with? <em>That</em> is why you're here.</p>

			<h4>Then get back to it!</h4>
			
			<p>Don't stop. Keep moving forward.</p>
