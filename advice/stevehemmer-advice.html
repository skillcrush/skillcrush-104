			<h4>Hit the Boards</h4>
			<p>I can't emphasise enough how important your mentors are you your learning.  Hit those message boards! You may feel rudderless at times, but I want to tell you, you're not!  </p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

			<h4>Coding is an Open-Book Test...</h4>
			<p>...and the WORLD is the book!  It's all around you!  Pull info from everywhere, everything, and everyone!  There is no such thing as cheating.  It's a different philosophy than most are used to.  We are the future. Open source!</p>
