            <h4>Turn off that tutorial and just practice!</h4>
            <p>When you first start it is really easy to stick to watching tutorials and to code along with an instructor who knows exactly what to do. But don't spend too much time on videos! As quickly as possible, start doing projects. Your projects will be far from perfect. However, only by doing projects will you truly discover what you know and what you need to work on.</p>

            <h4>That bug is probably not that serious...</h4>
            <p>It's really easy to get overwhelmed when your code is broken. You start to feel like you don't know anything. You rethink your life goals, you start posting all of your questions in that forum for newbies, and then nobody answers quickly so you feel lost… Stop. Take a deep breath. Read over your code. Most bugs are actually the result of bad grammar (e.g. a missing semicolon!). Chances are that is your error. If that is not the case, tell yourself “I can do this.” You can! Then think about why your code may have not worked and think about how you can approach your problem differently.</p>

            <h4>Be a part of the community but don't ask others right away...</h4>
            <p>Participate in forums and meetups. And, yes, network, network, network! But if you are stuck on something, you should probably try solving it on your own first, especially if you are just starting out. Like I said before, you probably know the answer. If you don't know it, try looking up an existing resource before you ask someone you know or before you post your question in a forum. Why? Because you'll need those research skills in the long run! And because by looking into existing resources you might discover a new topic.</p>

            <h4>Have FUN!</h4>
            <p> Do I really need to explain this one? :) If you are thinking of making coding a part of your life, it should be something you enjoy.</p>
