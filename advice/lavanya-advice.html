			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits. Take breaks when stuck with a problem and an extra pair of trained eyes won't hurt.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>Make a written note  of of the errors tackled and solved so that you could rather spend time tackling the new errors. Don't forget to reward yourself after crossing set thresholds or obtaining desired results. Make pictorial diagrams of context while learning so as to recollect the concepts learnt in a jiffy.</p>
