			<h4>Be Patient with Yourself</h4>
			<p>Patience is not something our society seems to value these days. We all want to be faster, better, stronger - and we want to be all of those things as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, success doesn't happen overnight. It takes practice, hard work, drive, and <strong> patience </strong> to see something all the way thorugh. </p>

			<p>As you learn to code, there will be times where something just isn't working right. You keep making change after change trying to tweak things to get the result you want, but since you don't know what is causing it all you have managed so far is to build up your frustration. Instead, take a deep breath and start plucking through your code. You may discover a missed period, comma, or semicolon is causing all of your woes - or you may discover a more serious error. You won't get there by banging on the keyboard and screaming in frustration though - that will just make it take longer. Forgive yourself for not being perfect, and then move on. </p>

			<h4>You Do You</h4>
			<p>We all have our own reasons for enrolling in Skillcrush courses - and your reason is the only one that matters to your success. If you are working on this to create a better life for your kids, but reach a point where you realize spending hours on the computer each night is wearing you out or keeping you from your family - take a break. The only reason to continue with the class is to make your life better, so if it is making it worse or you juse need to focus on something else for a minute, go do it!</p>

			<p>But come back. It is easy to put off something once you have stepped away. Expect and want of yourself what you wanted when you first shelled out the cash. </p>

			<p>Keep going until you find your path. Figure out what excites you about code or technology and then use the classes to get you to your goal. So what if you are not a genius coder, your newfound skills could help you land a job as a technical writer or project manager because you now understand the process. There are many paths to success - and you just need one. </p>
