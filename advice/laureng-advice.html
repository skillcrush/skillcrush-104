			<h4>Be a Snail</h4>
			<p>Whatever you do, don't rush this process! Don't get all sweaty and clammy and antsy-pantsy, propelling yourself forward just for the sake of progress. Listen, I get it. There's nothing more satisfying than putting a check next to those little lesson boxes.</p>

			<p>But, in the long run, you're only shortchanging yourself. If you want to learn this stuff, and I mean REALLY learn it, take the time to do things from scratch, make mistakes, and sure, get behind schedule sometimes. GO. SLOW.</p>

			<h4>Dream Lightly</h4>
			<p>Resist the urge to dream up an entire life plan that involves being the World's Best Super Awesome Coder. We're all on a journey here, and if you really want to end up someplace you LOVE, dream lightly. Make plans, but don't kill yourself to make them happen.</p>

			<p>Hey, maybe you ARE the world's next super awesome coder. Or, maybe you'll use your skills for something else entirely that makes you WAY happier. Be open to the excitement of NOT knowing where you'll end up. Chances are, you'll actually get where you wanna go.</p>
