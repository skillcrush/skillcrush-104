			<h3>Keep it Simple</h3>
			<p>
				Regardless if this is the first time you are programming or if have experimented with it in the past. <Span>Keep it Simple.</Span> It took me way longer to do my milestone project as I felt that I needed to have it perfect and it had to do everything I invisioned my site to do.  After realizing I was over complicating it, I decided that I had was enough to move to the next SkillCrush course. Looking back I wish I would have not overcomplicated things in and just stuck to the basics as there was a ton of time wasted. :( Don't let that happen to you!  <span>KEEP IT SIMPLE</span>... well at least to start out :)
