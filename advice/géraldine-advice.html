			<h4>1) Don't Give Up!</h4>

			<p>If every developer gave up the first time they saved their project and things went completely wrong, there would be no developers. Heck, there would probably not even be an Internet with anything more than “Hello World” pages.

			Failure is key to success in web development. The path between your idea and the webpage you want to build is a series of problems that have to be solved, and very rarely are they solved on the first try.

			Even the best developers in the world regularly come across problems that require them to save, test, and debug repeatedly until they find the right solution. It's in this that we find new and more efficient ways to get things done.</p>

           <h4> 2) Start Simple and Work Your Way Up</h4>

			<p>It is really easy to fall into a trap where you are jumping too far ahead on a project. We see these things on webpages and they look so simple, but getting from a point where you are learning body tags in HTML to doing complex methods in JavaScript doesn’t happen overnight.

			Consider starting with some beginning online courses that teach you the basics of HTML5 and CSS. This will get you where you need to be to start adding additional features to your work like incorporating PHP or JavaScript, and to do things like interact with a CMS.

			You can also take classes online to help you get started in an organized setting. We have outlined some of these online learning tools in our guide.</p>



			<h4>3) Don’t Be Afraid to Learn New Things</h4>

			<p>You will never stop learning as a developer. There will always be a new process or a new codebase that changes anything and everything you knew before. If you want to keep up you have to constantly be open to new ideas and new methods, and be willing to learn and try new things.</p>

			<p>The latest web technologies we are using today will be obsolete in no time, and you will need to be ready to pivot when that time comes.</p>
