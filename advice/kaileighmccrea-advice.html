      <h4>No, you will never know everything but it will all make sense eventually!</h4>
      <p>When you start learning to program, the amount you don't know can feel overwhelming. The truth is, there are basics that you'll get the hang of with time, but developers are constantly learning. The real trick is learning how to solve problems that you have never solved before, and learning how to learn as you go. </p>

      <p>Don't give up when it gets hard. Take a break, get a snack, watch some tv, work on something else, reboot your brain, and come back and try again. There is nothing wrong with putting something down. What matters is whether you pick it back up again.</p>
