			<h4>Borrow your designer’s eyes</h4>
			<p>Not literally … but you cannot become a good front-end developer if you do not appreciate good design. Designs rarely translate 1:1 in browsers. Sometimes you even don’t have designs, especially responsive versions.</p>

			<p>As a front-end developer you will be making a lot of small design decisions for your designer. Learn what makes good design so your designer can approve them with a smile.</p>

			<h4>Practice</h4>
			<p>Practice, practice, practice. Did I mention practice?</p>
			<p>Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, Jimi Hendrix – they reached the pinnacle of their respective fields by shooting free-throws, deking out pylons, and shredding some mean riffs over and over again. If you want to be a better front-end developer, regular practice should be incorporated into your schedule.</p>

			<h4>Take Care of Yourself</h4>
			<p>Being seated at a desk, writing code for 50 hours a week can be draining on your body and your mind. That’s’ why it’s important to stimulate your body and mind with non-digital activities. Hit the gym, join a volleyball team, learn to play the piano, take a cooking class – whatever! As long as you find something that takes you away from the digital world on a regular basis, your body and mind will thank you. Throw in some healthy eating habits and 8 hours of sleep a night and you’ll find you’ll have more energy throughout the work day, be more productive, and make less errors in your coding. The happy front-end developer is a healthy front-end developer, so dust of those running shoes today!</p>

			<h4>Google, google, google</h4>
			<p>Google will become your new best friend. If you are stuck on a problem, Google it! more than likely, someone out there has the same problem. The answer is out there. You just need to Google!</p>
