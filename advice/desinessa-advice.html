			<h4>Practice!</h4>
			<p>They say <em>&#8220;Practice make perfect!&#8221;</em>, I'd say perfection is anttanble and disabilitating when trying to achieve, however, practice commits whatever you do to your muscles memory, let's call it you brain memory. </p>
            <p>After commiting your changed every hour a day &mdash; you do not need your cheetsheat anymore. After doing so for a few days in a row &mdash; you can teach someone esle how to do it. After practicing for a few weeks &mdash; it's commited to your brain and you can devote that valuable learning space for anything else. </p>
            <p>Just keep practicing and it becomes your nature! </p>
			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
