			<h2>It's never too late to learn a new skill.</h2>
			<p>I had two degrees and seven years of work experience in an unrelated field when I began learning to code. I had this sort of mental block, like I had already put my time, and oh well, now I was stuck with that as my career for-ev-er. That was a big lie! It's never too late to learn something new.</p>

			<h2>You CAN do it.</h2>
			<p>My early attempts at learning to code were frustrating and led me to believe that I was incapable of learning because coding was so far over my head. That was another great big lie! I took a hard look at those around me who were living my dream and realized that they are not so different from me. If they can do it, I can do it, and so can you. So go do it!</p>

			<h2>Be kind to your mind.</h2>
			<p>Learning to code is like coding your brain, only your brain takes longer to process new information than your computer does! Be kind to your mind by not being hard on yourself when you do not initally understand something. Usually, once you sleep on it a night or two, it will begin to make sense. Be compassionate toward yourself, and support yourself in this process as you would do for your best friend. Allow yourself to fail, and then try again!</p>
