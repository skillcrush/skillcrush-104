			<h4>You just need <span>one</span>!</h4>
			<p>Once you've learned one language, you can learn many languages. It's the process of learning the language, and figuring out ways to use it that really helps. Lots of languages have a lot of similarities. If you get a handle on one, you'll be able to pick up more and know that you can do it.</p>


			<h4>Take a <span>chance</span> on yourself</h4>
			<p>You're worth it. You can learn what you need to get where you want to go. Don't give up, and don't think less of yourself for taking the long way around.</p>

			<h4>Be brave and <span>Google</span> it</h4>
			<p>Remember that everyone is a newbie at some point. Even if they have forgotten what that's like. Be brave when you try to build a new thing, and learn how to google for answers to things when you get stuck, or ideas for doing things. Everyone does this, so it's definitely not cheating.</p>
