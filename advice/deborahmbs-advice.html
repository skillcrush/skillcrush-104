				<h4>Just do it</h4>

				<div class="deborahmbs-advice-101">
					<p>I have been thinking of learning how to code for ages. I have read many books on the topic, gone through numerous online how to's and watched Youtube Tutorials. Unfortunately I could not decide on what language to start which lead me to reading more, but I actually never started to code myself.</p>

					<p>The big mistake was just gathering information instead of <span class="deborahmbs-emphasize">using the gathered information</span>. It is a more or less learning a new language by only studying the grammar. This way it stays gibberish and it will not stick.</p>
				</div>

			
			<h4>Free vs Paid</h4>
				<div class="deborahmbs-advice-101">
					<p>There are many free ressources online. Some are good, otheres are not so good. Main thing there is a lot of information available, but <span class="deborahmbs-emphasize">what should you choose?</span></p>

					<p>I highly disliked the lack of structure in the free online material, but I was hesitant about paying for a course. My solution was to do free trials, so I could get an overview of the course material and teaching style. Many of these payed courses have a really supportive online community which helps a lot when you get stuck.</p>

					<p>My preference is go for a payed course and use free ressources to give you a different perspective on the current topic you are studying.</p>
				</div>

				<h4>Before you move on</h4>

				<div class="deborahmbs-advice-101">
					<p>Once I actually started to practice, I was so eager to learn that I moved to quickly from HTML, to CSS, to Javascript...</p>

					<p>I did the exercises I had to do, but I did not really know what I was doing. So I took a break and started all over again. However this time, I took my time to learn and <span class="deborahmbs-emphasize"> enjoy the learning process </span> instead of being focused on many destinations.</p>
