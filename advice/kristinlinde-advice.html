			<h4>Practice Make Perfect</h4>
			<p>Its an age old saying, but it is holds very true when learnign to code. The more you do something, the faster it becomes second nature and gets committed to muscle memory.</p>

			<p>When I am learnign somethign new, oftern times I will go through the excersise once, make sure It is completed correctly, then delete everythgin and start again. I sometimes do it three or four times. Then when I really need to do whatever the excersise was about, I am very familiar with the steps needed to make it happen.</p>

			<h4>Wrap Your Head Around as Much as Possible</h4>
			<p>One of the things that is most important for me when learning something new is to not only understand how to do it, but also why you are doing it, how it works, etc. This helps me, especially when learnign a programing langiuage, to "think" in that language, which in turn helps me be able to use it as it was intended.</p>
            
            <h4>Don't Give Up!</h4>
            <p>Learnign a programing language is not easy. But if you keep at it, and strive for that "Ahh Ha" moment, it iwll come. Just stay focused, practice and keep your head up!</p>
