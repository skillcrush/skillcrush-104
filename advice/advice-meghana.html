					<h3>Intimidation is your friend!</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<p>Remember back in high school, when you studied hard before the exam but when you saw your question paper
						you were just so intimidated by the questions to even recollect a single word for which you burnt many a dozen midnight lamps?
						Yea right, programming aint that different sometimes!
						When you start programming you are excited and you learn the initial HTML+CSS with the enthusiasm of a kid in a candy store!
						But as you slowly progress to Responsive Web Development (which I like to call RWD) that's when the gameboard shifts
						to a parallel universe that you dreamt of travelling to, but never imagined you would ever get an opportunity.
						Now you're like the mouse in the maze experiment, the directions are there but you're just too muddled to think clear!
						In other wise words, you are intimidated but that intimidation is good my friend. It only makes you strive harder to understand
						the how everything works and the key to solving that is Simplicity!</p>
					</div>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-4">
						<h3> Simplicity as the Key!</h3>
					</div>
				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<p>Simplicity is a simple term but why is it the key to intimidating codes? The reason again is simple - ok I know
						I might sound confusing now just read on I promise things will be clear! When you keep your codes simple you will be able to
						understand how every line in that code responds to your changes, thereby you get a better understanding how everything works.
						<span>Hey no one said the path to coding was easy!!</span> </p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-4">
						<h3>Practice makes you better!</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-8">
						<p>Yeah, the saying never gets old! Practice is what moulds you to be better at what you are learning, especially when you
							are dealing with intimidating lines of codes. I practiced my HTML and CSS codes a lot when I had the catch-up week but when it
							came to the RWD catch up week I hardly did anything! Talk about being intimidated by that popular kid in school but still
							playing it cool so you dont come across as an easy target. Yeah well, thats what I was trying to do in the RWD catch up week
							so much that by the time I entered the GIT 105 topic I dont think I can remember anything at all! If only I had practiced my RWD
							codes and done some coding I am sure would have entered 105 feeling a wee bit more confident.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-med-12">
								<p>For my parting words, all I would say is embrace that you are learning something that is intimidating, challenging and yet not
								as difficult as it seems to be, it is all in your head. Remember once upon a time even Everest seemed unconquerable! </p>
								<p>And with that (so called) inspiring advice I leave you to striving to learn. <span>Happy Learning Folks!!!</span></p>
