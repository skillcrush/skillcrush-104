			<h4>Imposter Syndrome Hurts</h4>
			<p>
                When I got to the portfolio website milestone, I felt I wasn't ready and it took me a long 
                time to finish that milestone... longer than it should have.
            </p>

			<p>
                However, it wasn't because I didn't have the skills neccessary to make this milestone. 
                It was imposter syndrome. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Imposter syndrome makes you feel inadequate to perform your job or role becasue you
                feel like.. well like an imposter, just posing for the job without actually knowing
                or being able to do anything. But it's not true and you have to fight it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've fought it plenty of times in my current career and I don't want it to hold me, or you back.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just remember, when you get a job or are applying for jobs, that you do have the skills neccessary.
                But also remember that the best way to get over it is just to do it, and prove to yourself that you 
                aren't an imposter. You are the real deal!
            </p>

			<h4>Practice, Practice, Practice</h4>
			<p>
                Any practice is good practice, and learning languages means that you just have to play around with them.
                That's really it. 
            </p>

			<p>
                Learning from the lessons gives you a grasp of how to write in the language. 
                But to really learn it, the only way to do it is to start writing whatever you can think of.
                Look up the api's, read the documentation, look for exercises and challenges on the web.
            </p>

			<p>
                When it comes to coding, practice really does make perfect.
            </p>

            <h4>Feedback sessions and office hours!</h4>
            <p>
                Attend as many feedback sessions and office hours as you can. They are awesome!
                The instructors are awesome, meeting classmates is awesome, and you learn so much!
                From feedback sessions and office hours I've learned learned and improved more than I ever would on my own.
            </p>
            <p>
                To piggy-back on that advice you should also use the group forums as much as possible.
                Don't be afraid to ask questions in them or in the info sessions.
