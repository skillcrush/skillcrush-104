				<h4>Don't be afraid to ask the question</h4>
				<p>When you start programming you're doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge and it can be scary.</p>

				<p>Don't be afraid to ask any and all questions you need to. It's one of the best ways to engage with peers and the coding community at large.  Chances are that someone has had the same problem as you and they have a great fix.  You're not alone!</p>

				<h4>Save all the resources</h4>
				<p>When you're learning with Skillcrush they give you tons of resources for so many things. Save them all! Every link, every cheatsheet and every temple.  You will have a whole lot more bookmarks on your browser but it is worth it.</p>
