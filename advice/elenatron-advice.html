			<h4>A Thurough Job Is A Job Well Done</h4>
			<p>Shortcuts or quitting are tempting but in the end a thurough, complete project done to the very best of your ability will help you grow and learn. A late project done correctly is of more use than an early project riddled with mistakes.</p>

			<h4>Let go of old habits</h4>
			<p>i learned how to code html by trial and error. not only is this the long way but letting go of old habits is tough. change is constant so learn to be flexible.</p>
