			<h4>Be not afraid!</h4>
            <p>If you are like me and you have NO background in tech, be not afraid! Take a deep, deep breath - it's fine. It's a language or a skill that you haven't learned yet; no one would expect you to speak French if you had never taken French before. And no one will expect you to code if you haven't coded before.</p>

			<h4>Replay replay - hey hey hey!</h4>
            <p>And use and abuse that pause button, baby! The beauty of Skillcrush or other web-based learning is the ability to leverage videos and tutorials at your own time and at your own pace. Don't rush; use it.</p>
