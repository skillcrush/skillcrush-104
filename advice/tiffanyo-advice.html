			<h2>Slow and Steady wins the Race</h2>
			<p>When you start programming, especially learning html, it seems rather easy. It quickly gets challenging as you start making things responsive and having to make a website look good on multiple devices.</p>

			<p>The thing that has helped me the most is to look at other sources and finding other explanations that make more sense to me. I use google often! If I still can't figure something out, I leave it alone for a while and come back, most of the time with a better understanding. Sometimes I will skip ahead in lessons to see if there are tips that will help with previous problems.</p>

			<p>The worst thing to do is let fear control you and shut down your brain. Keep an open mind; it is the only way new things can get in.</p>

			<h2>Take Notes</h2>
			<p>Notes are helpful because you write it in a way that you understand something. It is unique to you.  </p>

			<p>It is best to write it out by hand, and then retype it later. It has been shown that the process of writing things by hand helps to retain more. If notes are typed, they are often exact copies of what is being said without much thought given to the subject matter. When you handwrite something, you can't write as fast so you have to think about the most important things and re-word it to keep it short.</p>

			<p>There is soooo much information that there is no way you can remember everything.</p>
