			<h4>Seek out the answers</h4>
			<p>There have been many occasions during my coding journey when I think of something I'd like to do as I work through a tutorial or add to a project, but don't quite remember how. Often, it's not something essential, so the easiest path would be to forget it and move on. Don't! That's the best learning opportunity you'll have. It's organic and meets an immediate need, so you're even more likely to remember the solution than if you'd encountered it in a generic tutorial. But only if you put in the time to seek out the answer, so get Googling!</p>
