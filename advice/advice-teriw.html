			<br><h4>Desire is Your Gift!</h4>

			<p>Skillcrush has opened my eyes to the many facets of desire.  I never dreamed that desire would play such a significant part in shaping a new me!
			Learning how to code has been a real eye-opening experience!  As I look back on my experience I can see how I was paralyzed by my own fears to embrace change.
			I now see how important it is to be less rigid toward how we think or do things and more open to being flexible in adapting to the evolving technology field.

			<h4>Desire is the Key</h4>
			
			<p>Desire, then, is the key in shaping your destiny.  I've learned from the powerful truth given in orientation, viewing master class videos, and interacting with instructors and classmates what to anticipate.<br> Some sage advice that I've learned is that persistence pays, positive thinking is powerful, keep it simple, and celebration is exhilarating!</p>
				
			<p>Therefore, if you have a question,don't be afraid to ask. If you're beginning to get angry, be happy. If you're ordinarily an organized rather than random thinker, read between the lines.<br>Lastly, celebrate that if you're reading this,<span class="special-1">"the light at the end of the tunnel isn't the illusion--the tunnel is".</span></p>

			<h4>The Gift of Desire</h4>

			<p>I've learned that<span class="special-1"> desire is...adaptive,  purposeful, persistent, persevere, intentional, deliberate, and strategic.</span>   Such a gift!<br> Congrats and crush on until you get your miracle!
