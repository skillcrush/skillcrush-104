			<h4>First: Think of your computer like a 3year old child!</h4>
			<div class = "cynthia-text">
				<p>When you start programming, a lot of the logic used may be confusing to you.  Why do I have to tell the computer this or that?  Do I need to always use this particular syntax? Why isn't this working the way I want it to? It all comes down to how you tell it to do each task. My granddaughter is a perfect example.  If you tell her to clean up the toys, she's completely overwhelmed.  Tell her though to pick up the red block, then the white block, then the purple block and she's off and running.  Think of your computer the same way and it will be easier to work through the logic of your coding.</p>

				<p>This concept works even better when you are writing pseudocode.  It's easier to break down the process if you imagine a simplistic audience that can only understand one step at a time.</p>

<div class="cynthia-text">
			<p>When I'm working away on my code, I work on one little piece at a time, make sure it is working as I expect, and then move on to the next piece.  There are two reasons for this.  First, it's much easier to find a bug when you are looking at one little change at a time.  If you make a change, and it doesn't work, you know that the last change was probably where the error is. </p>

			<p>Second, and more importantly, each time the code works you can do a mini happy dance.  My husband always knows I've got something right when he hears me exclaim "Ooo!  It works!"</p>

			<p>It may sound silly, but that little exclamation reminds me that I can learn to code and when I come to a similar piece of code in future, I know I can do it, because I've done it before!   Ooo!  I remember that!!!</p>
