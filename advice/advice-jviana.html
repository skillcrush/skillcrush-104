			<h4>Just do, and do, and do</h4>
			<p>Learning to code is learning a new language, only its disguised because you can write english words. Take time, pay attention to details, write everything down twice. You cant learn spanish or german in a few days, coding is no different. Commit it all to muscle memory. And dont be too hard on yourself.</p>
