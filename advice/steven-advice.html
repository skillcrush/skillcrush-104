			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>Confusion means you're learning. Don't be afraid of the things you don't know. Take note of that feeling and use it to your advantage. Break it down into simple ideas and digestable bits.</p>
            

			<h4>Believe it before you see it. </h4>
			<p>Trust the process. When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
