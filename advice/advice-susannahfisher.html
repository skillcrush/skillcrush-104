			<h4 class="susannahfisher-advice">As with all adventures, there will be successes and misfire. But you can always count on learning and growing from it.</h4>

				<p class="susannahfisher-advice"> If you remember a few things, learning to code will always be fresh and fun.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Practice, practice, practice - especially when it's the most difficult. Keep at it and don't quit. The epiphany is on its way!</li>
					<li>Take a walk. Don't be afraid to just get up and go for a walk when nothing you are doing seems to work and you keep hitting the wall. Sometimes you just need to walk your way to the solution.</li>
					<li>Reach out to your community - other Skillcrushers, online communities such as Stack Overflow, a mentor, your team, the Google braintrust, etc. They've been there and can help.</li>
					<li>And finally... always check your code. Sometimes you make that wall yourself by something as simple as not closing a bracket. It happens to EVERYONE no matter what stage of career. We are a society in a hurry and these things happen. So validate your code!</li>
