			<h4>PATIENCE!</h4>
			<p>I think the #1 piece of advice I would give myself before learnin to code is BE PATIENT WITH YOURSELF!</p>

			<p>You have never done this before. You are learning a completely different language and it's not always going to be easy. It will be frustrating and challenging but worth it! Be kind to yourself and do not beat yourself up if you don't understand something right away. Keep working at it and be PATIENT</p>

			<h4>DON'T BE AFRAID OF ASKING QUESTIONS</h4>
			<p>I don't know about you, but I have always hated asking questions. I thought it made me look weak or stupid if I didn't understand something and I thought I was bothering people by asking for further explanation or guidance.</p>

			<p>It's so important to ask, ask, and ask again! And as we've learned, being able to explain a problem is a key element of being a successful developer and contributing member of a team.</p>
