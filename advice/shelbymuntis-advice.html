			<h4>Be Patient with Yourself!</h4>
			<p> If you are an artistically minded person like myself, coding took some getting used to. I was going from a career where much of the beauty I created was instinctual and organic to a feild where if I had a typo I thought my computer would explode.</p>

			<p>Be patient and take a breath. I had to remind myself that coding was in many ways like learning to paint or draw and if I believed anyone could be an artist, I had to believe anyone could code, all it took was time, practice, making mistakes, and patience.</p>

			<h4>Learn to Revel in Your Mistakes</h4>
			<p>When I first started coding, I was so concerned with trying to get it right the first time, getting that "gold star", but it just doesn't work that way. I can honstly say that mistakes have been my best teacher. If I am doing everything right all the time, am I really learning?</p>

			<p>The answer is no. So when you make a mistake, just do what I do- I square my shoulders, look ahead, and say "I am a strong sensual woman" like my feminist hero Tina Belcher would and move the f*ck on</p>

			<p>I know we're just talking about coding here, but seriously, I do that for everything and it has totally changed the way I view learning</p>

			<h4>Keep Your End Goal in Mind aka Find Your Why</h4>
			<p>This is the most motivating piece of advice I have for you today. As I am sure you know by now, coding is no walk in the park. Okay, it is kind of like a park where mostly it is pretty beautiful but then there's this path of thorns, and you just have to keep going.</p>

			<p> Here is where my advice comes in. Find you why. Why are you doing this? Do you want freedom? Independence? Financial stability? To travel? For your family? Whatever it is, whenever you get out your computer to work, bring something with you to remind you of your why. </P>

			<p>For me, it is my family so I have a picture of me and my husband on our wedding day on my desk. I am doing this for us and the life we want to have together, free from a 9-5. Whatever your why is, put something there to remind you for the days when you have a bad coding day.</p>
