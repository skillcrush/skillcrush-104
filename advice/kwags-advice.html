				<h4>Curiosity did <span>not</span> kill the cat!</h4>
				<p>When you first start coding, it can be an anxiety ridden journey, worrying that you’re going to wreck something. Instead of fearing the code, be curious and make changes.</p>

				<p>What will happen if I do this? Ok, what about this? Try something new and see what happens. Learn from working through the code. Check out your changes, problem-solve and try some more changes.</p>

				<h4>The expert was a beginner once too.</h4>
				<p>Remember, everyone started as a beginner. Take it at your own pace, don’t compare yourself to others, compare yourself to who you were yesterday. By learning something new each day, you will be consistently improving yourself and your skills.</p>

				<p>Every little bit of knowledge and experience builds upon your coding skills. The more time you spend practicing, the more you will continue to grow and learn becoming closer to an “expert.”</p>

				<p>Be kind to yourself. Acknowledge your accomplishments and focus on the process.</p>
