			<h4>Don't compare</h4>
			<p>When I started, I kept comparing my progress and projects to other Skillcrushers. But this doesn't do any good! Everyone is working at their own pace and has their own style.</p>

			<p>Keep working whenever you can. Even if you fall behind a little, just keep trucking along.</p>

			<h4>Celebrate the good days and work through the bad days.</h4>
			<p>I thought this whole process would be a bit challenging, but mostly exciting new steps every day. Some days I don't make it anywhere.</p>

			<p>I make sure to pat myself on the back on the days that I tackle new mountains. And on bad days, I have to learn how to shake it off and pick myself back up.</p>

			<p>You can't appreciate the good without the bad!</p>
