			<h4>Embrace change and discomfort</h4>
			<p>When you first start learning to code, you may run into roadbumps along the way. Perhaps some material does not make sense, your code is not functioning correctly, or you just feel entirely out of your comfort zone. These are all things that accompany learning something new. </p>

			<p>Acknowledge these discomforts and use this time to learn how to find additional resources, work on your problem-solving skills, and learn new things about yourself. Learn to enjoy the journey and embrace the change that comes along with it.</p>

			<h4>Don't expect perfection your first, or tenth, time</h4>
			<p>Like any other skill, learning to code requires lots of time and practice. Do not expect your code to turn out exactly as your planned the very first time you build an application or web page. You will have plenty of time to review and revise, so do not get hung up on the little things.</p>

			<p>Instead, focus your attention of making your code simple and functional. Make sure your code is easy for you and others to read and that it works when you open it in a web browser or run tests on it. It may not look the prettiest or be the most efficient way to do something, but you will have time to clean it up later.</p>
