				<h4>It's okay to feel discouraged at times.</h4>
				<p>When I first started programming I was full of worries and fears. Fear that I wasn't smart enough to learn something so complex and worry that my code wasn't good enough.</p>

			<div class="two">
				<h4>Ask for help when you need it.</h4>

				<p>What helped me was reaching out to the community in our google groups and beyond. The development community is amazing and everyone is super supportive!</p>

			<div class="three">
