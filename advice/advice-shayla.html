			<h4>Imagine yourself a month from now</h4>
			<p>Haven't there been SO many times in your life when you go through a big change and you look back on yourself from a month or a year ago and think, "Wow, she had no idea how much she would learn and grow in that time, but she did." I always wish I could go back to myself and say, "STOP WORRYING! It will all come together in the end, you'll see!"</p>
			<p>So now sometimes I like to think about myself a month in the future, coming back to say those things to me. :)</p>

			<h4>Don't wait until you feel comfortable</h4>
			<p>No one is ever ready and there's never going to be a point where you think, "Yep, now I'm ready to go out into the world and pitch someone to be their web developer!" Not going to happen.</p>
			<p>So get out there and do it. Going through the process of working with a client is a better crashcourse than anything you can pay for. You'll make mistakes, sure, but you can recover. Plus, it starts bringing in that sweet $.</p>
			
			<h4>No one knows what they're doing</h4>
			<p>I'm really lucky, because my partner is a software developer and he let me in on a little secret: NO ONE knows what they're doing.</p>
			<p>The Internet is held together with scotch tape and chewing gum. Professional developers use hacky work-around fixes all the time, because sometimes that's the only (or the fastest) way to solve a problem.</p>
			<p>No one is a wizard, we're all just muddling muggles.</p>
