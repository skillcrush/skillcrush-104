			<h4>&#10003; It's A-OK to eff things up a bit.</h4>
			<p>I find that I learn best when I fail upward. I'm not scared to admit that I screwed up my fair share of code while learning the ins and outs of HTML and CSS. I immediately started applying my new skills to my email campaigns at the office, and while I have no MAJOR blunders to report, let's just say those first few emails are...questionable. Thankfully, I have a <em>very</em> understanding boss who is 1 billion supportive of the learning process.</p>

			<p>P.S. We may or may not have had to roll back the master website code a couple of times. :D Had I not had the opporitunity to EPICALLY fail, I might not know which mistakes to NOT make.</p>

			<h4>&#10003; It's okay to say "SCREW THIS" and walk away for a day or week or month or two.</h4>
			<p>One thing that continues to amaze me is how my brain puts puzzle pieces together when I least expect it. I'll have days when I get soooo frustrated with code and give up on it. That's completely okay! I've discovered that when I come back to it, magic happens and the pieces fit together and I think I'm silly for spending so much time on a padding confusion or something.</p>

			<p>This is a normal and will save you loads of actual time in the long run. If your stuck, maybe you should shut the laptop for a minute, okay? I know it's hard sometimes (like walking away from a damn cookie) but trust me, future self will thank you.</p>
