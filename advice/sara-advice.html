			<h4>Not to sound like a cliche, but ...</h4>
			<p>If at first you don't succeed, try, try again! Odds are you won't understand everything right away. I know I definitely don't. It's extremely easy to get frustrated when you run into something you don't understand or can't get something to work properly. Keep trying. Ask questions. Google it. If you stick with it, when you figure it out or get it to work, you'll feel amazing.</p>

			<h4>It's never too late to learn new technology.</h4>
			<p>When I was younger, I loved building my own personal websites. I'd spend hours teaching myself HTML and Photoshop. I'd constantly change the layouts of my personal sites just because it was fun. It was fun to see what people did with their own personal sites. But somewhere along the line, I stopped playing with HTML. I'd thought of it as a hobby. Figured I probably should have majored in something related to computers to pursue it as a career. Years later, I realized I missed it. It's been fun to dive back into HTML and CSS, seeing what I remembered, and updating my skills. It's never too late to start learning.</p>

			<h4>Don't be afraid to take a break.</h4>
			<p>If you hit a roadblock and really can't figure something out, try stepping away from it for a little bit. Take a walk. Clear your head. Take a deep breath. It's easy to get really frustrated. Sometimes a little break is all you need to help conquer those roadblocks.</p>
