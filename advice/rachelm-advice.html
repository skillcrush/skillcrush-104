			<h4>Don't Rush</h4>
			<p>Coding is a skill that develops over time. There's so much to learn that there's no reason you should expect yourself to learn it all in one day. Take breaks and learn complementary skills simultaneously.</p>

			<p>I've learned that you have to just put in the work. You can't learn if you don't work and if you don't learn, you can't improve. </p>

			<h4>It's okay to be bad</h4>
			<p>Sounds weird, but it's okay to be bad at something. All you can do is appreciate that you're giving it your all. We all start out bad at things, but it's up to us to decide if want to be better.</p>

			<p>It will never end, accept it.</p>

			<p>From here on out you will be learning for all eternity - embrace it. It's not a chore. It's an opportunity to make yourself more valuable and more capable. </p>
