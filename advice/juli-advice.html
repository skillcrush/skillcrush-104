			<h4>Code Every Day!</h4>
			<p>Don't compare your journey to other's.</p>
			<p>Don't quit asking questions.</p>
			<p>Don't give up when you don't understand and your head is spinning and you just want to kick a chair...just step away. Some times distance from a problem allows clairty to surface. The phrase "sleep on it" doesn't come from no where.</p>
			<p>Don't ever allow yourself to feel stupid. You aren't. Coding is hard and it takes patience and determination - no matter what the hacker says.</p>
			<p>Do enjoy the ride.</p>
