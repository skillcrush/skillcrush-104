			<h4>Fear is your best friend.</h4>
			<p>Don't fight it, just manipulate it so you have it on your back, pushing you to the forward thing to do. That was one of the best advices I got when I was studying for actor.</p>

			<p>It's the title of a John Cale song by the way. And it's been a while I had that advice.</p>

			<p>Yet it still stands.</p>

			<h4>Don't forget to change</h4>
			<p>I forget that always when things are going just right. Until I get kicked out of my welness little-thingy-dingy and I realize: ok, apparantly it's time for something new.</p>

			<p>(And don't believe the hype, of course...)</p>
