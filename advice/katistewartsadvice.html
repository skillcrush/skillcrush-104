			<h4>Patience</h4><br>
			<p>I would say that the most important thing when you start learning something completely new is <strong>patience</strong>. In the beginning, one doesn't have any idea about the complexity of a field, and one tends to push oneself to want to learn too much in a too short period of time. But it is important to be patient because othwerwise one risks becoming discouraged, burning out quickly and maybe even giving up entirely. Just one step at a time, that would be the most important thing, I think.</p><br>
