			<p class="advice__content font--normal">My good friend gave me this sage advice: in order to stay motivated, despite the inherent frustration of learning a programming language on your own, the key is to focus on byte-sized goals.  Each achievement helps you maintain momentum.</p>

			<h4 class="advice__heading coda font--mid">Use The Google</h4>
			<p class="advice__content font--normal">Every programmer will admit that the internets themselves are their greatest resource; most problems you run into have already been solved by someone, who then posted the solution on the internet.  And the best part is that often that solution won't actually work 100% in your own edge case, so you'll still learn by figuring out how to apply the solution to your particular situation.  Sites like <a class="" href="stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a>, <a class="" href="http://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>, <a class="" href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a>, and <a class="" href="http://codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> are awesome for finding a wealth of reliable free information.</p>

			<h4 class="advice__heading coda font--mid">You're Never Going To Learn It All</h4>
			<p class="advice__content font--normal">I once read a quote regarding the Mandarin language, which I'll paraphrase as "even studying Mandarin your whole life, by the end you still won't know every character", which I find very relevant to programming.  I'll follow that with another famous Chinese proverb: "Be not afraid of growing slowly, be afraid only of standing still".</p>
