			<h4>Do the basics well</h4>
			<p>When I started out programming i wanted to jump right into the deep end thinking ill be able to start building up my knowledge in a matter of weeks.</p>

			<p>what i quickly realised is that its better to build your knowledge from the ground up. Learning the basics well and then move on to something that challenges you a little more and so on</p>

			<h4>It just takes time</h4>
			<p>There is no easy way sometimes, and learning a new programming language or a new technology just takes time</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process. Good things come to those that wait</p>
