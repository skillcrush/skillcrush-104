			<h2>Coding is hard until it's not</h2>
			<p>When you begin coding it's good to remember that you are litereally learning new languages. Learning a language is <span>hard</span> and it's important to remember that practicing it as much as possible will make it easier.</p>

			<p>After you have been coding in a specific language for enough time, there will come a point where it's easy and feels like second nature. There will always be things you have to look up and new things to learn but that will become part of the fun.</p>
