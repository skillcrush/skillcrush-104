			<h3>Don't be too hard on yourself...</h3>
			<p> Sometimes It's hard to see where you will be with time. Everything seems like an uphill struggle. One day you will be writing code and feel like a genius. The next day you will want to cry and give up. They key here is to never surrender.</p>
			<p>They say that anything worth having is worth fighting for, or something like that... I may have paraphrased it, I don't know. But the point is, if it came to you easily then it wouldn't be that great when you finally got it. It's through the struggles and frustration that you get to actually feel the joy when you look back and see you have actually done it. You can code.</p>
			<p>It may not be as cool looking as the movies, but friggin a, it's fun!</p>
