		<h1>Hi! My name is Keri & I wanted to share a few tips as you begin your code-learning journey.</h1>

			<h4>Don't be afraid to ask questions!</h4>
			<p>I have always been a question asker &amp when I'm learning something so completely new, like coding, the questions just keep coming.  You can't be afraid to raise your hand, post a message, or email your teacher.  Question asking is not a sign of ignorance, it's quite the opposite.  It shows you are not only engaged in the learning process, but you want to understand what you're doing, not just get the "right" answer.</p>

			<p>I have also found, that often times when I'm confused about something, I'm not the only one...I just might be the only one willing to "look stupid."  But remember, none of us are experts, that's why we're taking a class...so ask away!</p>
		
			<h4>Don't let the frustration take you down!</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new skill, you are often taking on something that is unfamilar and confusing at first.  The longer you work at it, the more you'll understand.  But there will be bumps along the way as you go through the learning process.  If you're like me, you don't like not being good at something or not understanding.  This can lead to great frustration when tackling new material.</p>

			<p>It's normal to feel frustrated &amp confused, but you have to be able to work through those feelings.  Sometimes this requires stepping away from a lesson for a few hours (or days!) just to clear your mind & giver yourself a break.  As you learn to code, you'll quickly become aware that often times the smallest errors (typos, missing semi-colons, etc...) are your biggest enemies.</p>

			<p>While no one likes to feel frustrated, it's a normal part of the learning process.  Even experts on a subject matter, at one time were new to that subject.  The difference is, they fought through the frustration &amp mastered their skill.</p>
