		<h1>My name is Ken Green ...</h1>
		<h4>... and I was asked to pass along some advice for "newbies"</h4>

			<p>First of all, I have a problem with the term "newbie".  I find
				it demeaning.  I have been a software developer for over 28 years and
				I still feel like a "newbie" quite often.  I try very hard to to keep
				the concept of Shosin in mind:</p>

			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin">
				<p>Shoshin (初心) is a concept in Zen Buddhism meaning "beginner's
					mind". It refers to having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and
					lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, even when studying
					at an advanced level, just as a beginner in that subject would. The
					term is especially used in the study of Zen Buddhism and Japanese
					martial arts.</p>
					<a class="citation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin">Source: Wikipedia</a>
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote cite="Shunryu Suzuki">
				<p>In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the
					expert's mind there are few.</p>
				<p class="citation">"Shunryu Suzuki"</p>
			</blockquote>

			<h3>Off the top of my head, two of the most valuable pieces of
				advice I can give:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><a

						Learn how to program deliberately and not by coincidence</a></li>

				<li><a

						"Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin</a></li>
