			<h4>Persist</h4>
			<p>When you feel confused or overwhelmed, it means you are learning something new. Keep going through it and the lights will come on at various points. It's so rewarding when suddenly- you get it.</p>

			<h4>Think about what you want and don't let others distract you from it.</h4>
			<p>You are learning tools that you know will give you more opportunities in your life, but it may be easy to get sidetracked by others' agendas. Continually ask yourself, 'what do I want?' and take the chance to re-focus. </p>
