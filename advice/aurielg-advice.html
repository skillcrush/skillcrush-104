			<h4>Have patience and confidence!</h4>
			<p>Learning something new can be extremely overwhelming and frustrating. Of course you want to create amazing websites, but this is a process that can't be rushed. It's exciting! It's challenging. Just be patient with yourself through all of the twists and turns.</p>
			<p>And be confident that you are in the right place and will one day be creating awe-inspiring projects with all the knowledge and skills you've gained. </p>

			<h4>Take a break.</h4>
			<p>Just when you think you've got it all mastered, something goes wrong! I've spent hours trying to fix something and gotten no where, except more frustrated and angry!! Taking a break to clear your mind helps enormously. Usually, when I get stuck and I come back hours or even days later, I can resolve the issue. Or a least, get some help. </p>
			<p>Breaks are your friend!</p>

			<h4>Celebrate!</h4>
			<p>Learning to code is not easy! Especially if you've never even seen a coding language before. Just know that you are awesome for take the leap to learn and grow. Every step is getting you closer to your goals and you will get there. But you took the leap and that is something to be proud of, as well as all of the small accomplishments you will have along the way.</p>
