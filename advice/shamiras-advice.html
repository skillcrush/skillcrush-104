			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<p>From personal experience I was confused about many things that has stopped me from continuing my coding journey. For instance, when I was learning CSS and came across understanding floats and clears, I was just all over the place. I wasn't just confused on what was happening but frustrated because I felt like I couldn't control it. Then I came across learning git and terminal, two things that once I saw it I just got confused. However after learning both from Skillcrush, I crushed my fears. Now I am more comfortable and no longer confused on how things work the way they do.</p>

			<p>I strongly believe in this because it's true to every word. The more you do, the better you get. That is eventually for everything and for newbie coders like me, I know it will help in the long run. Also after practicing for so long it just becomes second nature for us!</p>
