			<h4>Don't give up!</h4>
			<p>There are many, many times when you feel like your brain may explode and there is no where for all the new information to go, but you can find a way.</p>

			<p>Perseverance is key and when what your were working on suddenly clicks, it is a fabulous (although at times, frustrating) feeling!</p>

			<h4>Be brave</h4>
			<p>Making changes, experimenting and seeing what things can do are all part of the process. Worse case scenario is you need to go back a few steps to make amendments, but that is ok. You won't break everything!</p>

			<h4>W3 schools is an excellent resource</h4>
			<p>I have found w3 schools so helpful in my coding. They have great tutorials and info in an easy to understand way and it has helped me out a lot! <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3 schools rules!</a> </p>

			<h4>Go for it!</h4>
			<p>You can always do more than you think you can, so just believe!</P>
