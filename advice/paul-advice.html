			<h4>What I learned</h4>
			<p>
				When I first started out learning web development, something I wish someone had told was, stick to one
				technology/language until you mater it. When you master that one, move to the next. In a world where
				every job seems to demand you know every language, framework, library out there, it's easy to try and
				tackle all at once. This was my mistake and I am now learning from it.
