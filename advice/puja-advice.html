			<h4>It's never too late to start!</h4>
			<p>You may be wondering to yourself "Am I too old to start something new?" Truth is, you are never too old to start something new!</p>

			<p>Skillcrush makes learning to code simple and fun. Of course, you will have to put in the time to learn and better understand what is being taught, but once you get the hang of it, you are on your way.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
