			<h4>Keep trying</h4>
			<p>Never give up! Yes, it is confusing and yes, you will get angry when things don't work like they are supposed to. But keep trying and trying again and again. The rewards will be worth it.</p>

			<p>Also, don't be afraid to try different things. Even if you think you won't like design as much as development... give it a go. You never know.</p><br>

			<h4>Courage is important</h4>
			<p>This one is not from me, but always nice to hear:</p>

			<p>Have the courage to live a life true to yourself, not the life others expect of you.</p>

			<p>There you go!</p><br>
