		<h1>Hi my name is Lorrie Pearson  and I have some advice for you!</h1>

			<h4>Confusion is your friend</h4>
			<p>Before beginning to code anything you have to plan because you need to know what you're gonna do before you do it. When you start
			planning your first web app you are doing something you have never done before. It's a new challenge and a new opportunity, but it is so
			exciting!
			<p>You will make mistakes and you will get confused, but this is a sign of learning. It taught me to use my resources and take lots of notes.
			When you write things down you commit the information to memory, so write it down. (You can thank me later).</p>
				
			<h4>Read a lot of code</h4>
			<p>It will give you ideas and efficient ways to implement your code. You are learning new technololgies. Becoming a Front-End Developer involves learning, practice, and research.
			The more you review, learn and practice, the better you get at it. I code every single day. It's the best way to keep implement your skills.</p>
			

			<h4>Write simple apps</h4>
			<p>It can be overwhelming to see complex projects but you can start writing very basic apps and build on that by adding more complex features.
			Break everything down into steps. A friend once told me, reduce it to the ridiculous. The simpler the better. Don't worry about being fast right now, be more concerned about learning it well enough to use and implement. The speed will come.
