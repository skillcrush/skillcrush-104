			<p>"The best advice I ever got was that knowledge is power and to keep reading." <br>-David Bailey</p>

			<p>"I think it's very important to have a feedback loop, where you're constantly thinking about what you've done and how you could be doing it better. I think that's the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself."<br>-Elon Musk</p>

			<p>"Many receive advice, only the wise profit from it."<br>-Harper Lee</p>

			<p>"The only thing to do with good advice is to pass it on. It is never of any use to onseself."<br>-Oscar Wilde</p>

			<p>"My advice to women in general: Even if you're doing a nine-to-five job, treat yourself like a boss. Not arrogant, but be sure of what you want - and don't alow people to run anything for you without your knowledge."<br>-Nicki Minaj</p>
