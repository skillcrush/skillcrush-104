			<h4>Just a Little Bit</h4>
			<p>Like learning anything, consistency is the key to coding. Doing a little bit every day will vastly improve your skills than doing a coding "dump" once a month.</p>

			<p>Set aside a few minutes each day- even 10 minutes will do- to go over a concept that you're unclear of or to work on a Skillcrush lesson. The great thing about the Skillcrush videos is that they're short. The majority of them are less than seven minutes. So have your laptop beside you while watch <em>Scandal</em> or <em>How to Get Away with Murder</em> and during commercials, practice your coding!</p>

			<h4>Find Your Path</h4>
			<p>Someone wrote a viral blog post, which got a gazillion, comments that Python is THE. NEXT. BEST. THING. and anyone who is anyone in tech should learn Python, work in Python, sleep, eat, and breath Python. Problem is? You hate Python.</p>

			<p>The great thing about tech is that there are so many options, so many different, exciting paths you can take. You don't have to follow what your best friend or second cousin's boyfriend's sister is doing.</p>

			<p>If you try front end development and realise that CSS is causing you to lose your hair, try back end! Don't like Ruby? Learn Drupal! Admitted to yourself that coding might not be your thing? Become a project manager or write about tech.</p>

			<p>There's a place for you in tech, no matter what program you want to learn. Find what makes you happy! Do your thing!</p>

			<h4>Mentor!</h4>
			<p>Some famous person once said that by helping others, you help yourself. This is true, even when you're learning to code. One of the best ways to get clear on a concept is to teach it someone else. </p>

			<p>I recommend that you start mentoring as early in your coding journey as you can. Don't worry about not knowing everything or not knowing enough. Think back to your first Skillcrush class, when you didn't know what HTML stood for. There are people in that boat and you can help them!</p>

			<p>There are a lot of beginner HTML/CSS classes for adults and kids, many of them only a few hours long on the weekend. Find one and mentor! Believe me, there's someone who <em>needs and wants</em> your help!</p>

			<p>The great thing about mentoring is that you'll learn a lot, too. There'll be a wide range of experiences and you can learn from other mentors. Plus, it's fun! (And there are usually cookies!) </p>
