			<div id="one">
					<h4>go exploring.</h4>
					<p>Don't be afraid to try new things<br>&amp; see what's out there!</p>
					<p>Experiment with your code<br>&amp; see what happens.<br>
					<br>Look at other people's code<br>&amp; test it out for yourself.<br>
					<br>Be curious and keep learning<br> &amp; trying new things. </p>

			<div id="two">
					<h4>retrace your steps.</h4>
					<p>When you get stuck,<br>go back to where you were when you got lost<br>&amp; try again.</p>
					<p>Getting stuck is like<br>taking the wrong fork in the road.<br>
					<br>Sometimes you have to backtrack a little<br>in order to move forward<br>
					<br>It can be super frustrating,<br>but it usually makes for a great story!</p>

			<div id="three">
					<h4>stop &amp; look around</h4>
					<p>Every once in a while,<br>take a breath &amp; look around.<br>Enjoy the view.</p>
					<p>Things that used to be<br>confusing or frustrating<br>are probably much easier now.<br>
				  <br>Take time to look around<br>&amp; see how far you've come.</p>

			<h4>Balance Play and Structure</h4>
			<p>Exploring is important.</p>
			<p>Having a structured, guided path laid out by experts is important.</p>
			<p>You need both to be successful. </p>
			<p>I spent a few months learning on Codecademy & Free Code Camp and playing around with WordPress and going to random meetups.
				It was really good for me because it allowed me to see what was out there and to start developing some basic understandings.
				That play and exploring helped me make a solid decision on what course to take and what career path to start down.
				It also helped me move through the courses more quickly and not be completely overwhelmed.
				I made a lot of mistakes and /'wasted/' a lot of time during those months.  But it really helped me when I did start working on something structured.
				All of that play and exploring and time wasting gave me a foundation and confidence that would have taken me much longer to develop with just a structured path alone.</p>
				<p>Right now, I love having the structure and community of Skillcrush.  And I know that I am in the right place right now.
					And I also know that I will be able to go back to playing and exploring with a whole new set of skills and understanding when the course finishes. </p>
