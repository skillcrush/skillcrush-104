			<h4>"Never give up, never surrender!" - Galaxy Quest</h4>
			<p>When something seems too hard, don't take that as a sign to quit. Though it might be tempting, never ever give up! Take a break and come back to it the next day if you need to; coding can be tricky and fresh eyes are often all you need! Don't worry, sometimes success just looks like repetitious failure.. Trust me, I've given up on many ventures and it is oddly satisfying. But not as satisfying as solving puzzles and knowing that you are building new skills!</p>

			<h4>When in doubt, Google it.</h4>
			<p>Sounds easy right? It is! Not only can you find answers to coding questions, but you can learn tips along the way without even realizing it. Reading posts from other confused coders and watching video tutorials is ridiculously helpful. But, it's most helpful when you're in the thick of it and actually NEED to find certain information. It's like learning to swim while you're drowning. But less scary. And not life-threatening.</p>
			
			<h4>Find a buddy.</h4>
			<p>If you're better at learning things in a group or with a partner, find another newbie to chat with! Or convince one of your friends to learn to code with you. Or just tie someone up and give them a laptop. But loosely so they can type.</p>
