			<h4>Don't be afraid to make mistakes</h4>
			<blockquote>Mistakes, obviously, show us what needs improving.<br />Without mistakes, how would we know what we had to work on?<br /> -- Peter McWilliams</blockquote>
			<p>New designers and developers make a lot of mistakes.  People who have been programming for 20+ years, like me, make a lot of mistakes.  Don't worry about how many mistakes you make. The trick is to <span class="emphasis">get up, fix them, and keep going.</span></p>
			
			<h4>Ask for help</h4>
			<p>Your Skillcrush instructors are there to help you.  Ask questions in the forums. Your fellow students may be struggling with the same problem.  Maybe someone else has already solved it, and can give you a hand. You'll never know unless you ask.</p> 
			
			<h4>Use on-line resources</h4>
			<p>There is a wonderful set of tutorials at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a>.  They cover just about every aspect of HTML and CSS, and they provide a practice area where you can try things yourself and see immediate results.  You can search for a term and find the reference page for it quickly and easily.</p>
			<p>Another good on-line resource is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a>. Search to see if your question has already been asked, and if not, ask it.  The articles there are super-helpful. The explanation of <em>why</em> something works can get a bit technical, but the articles do explain what to do to make something work.</p>
			
			<h4>Invest in a couple of good reference books if you can</h4>
			<p>My favorites are the "Missing Manual" series (Creating a Website: The Missing Manual, HTML5: The Missing Manual, etc.).  They're not books that make you want to sit down and read them straight through.  But they're really well-indexed and therefore make it easy to look up the topic you need.<p>
			<p>While I love my Kindle and e-books in general, I still think it's best to invest in a paper copy.  That makes it easier to mark all the pages you will want to be able to come back to later.</p>
			
			<h4>Don't give up!</h4>
			<p>In the words of the immortal Winston Churchill, <span>"Never, never, never give up."</span>  Learning a new language is hard.  Learning new programming languages, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. is also hard.  Stick to it, and you'll find it gets easier with time.</p>
			<h4>And a final word...</h4>
			<p>When you're writing code, there will be a lot of times when you don't feel like you are getting the results you wanted.  I'll leave you with a final quote from Albert Einstein:
			<blockquote>Results!<br />
				Why, man, I have gotten a lot of results.</br>
				I know several thousand things that won't work.<br />
				 -- Albert Einstein</blockquote>
