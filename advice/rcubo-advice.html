			<h4>Learn best coding practices from the get go!</h4>
			<p>I learned how to code at university at first, but they were too deep into making us solve hard problems with code rather than learning the industry standards</p>

			<p>Plus, in addition, the languages they use are often outdated! I know some people in CS learning Pascal!</p>

			<p>And they don't teach git either...</p>

			<h4>Always learn a bit every day</h4>
			<p>It's easy to get absorbed into work, family and stuff.</p>

			<p>However, if you improve just a little bit every day in what you do, you'll be a master eventually!</p>
