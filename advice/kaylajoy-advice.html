			<h4><strong><em>Perserverance</em></strong></h4>
			<p>I can't even tell you how many times I wanted to throw in the towel on a project. Messed up something and can't find what's throwing it off. Or I'm trying to figure out the difference between, wrappers, or containers, or divs, and do I use a main or a section? Half the time I don't think I have any idea what I'm doing and I'm googling this or looking back through my skillcrush bookmarks and I feel like I'm in way over my head. But still, you just gotta keep going. It's part of the process.</p>

		<div id="practice">
			<h4><strong><em>Practice</em></strong></h4>
			<p>But then I remember, at some point, all developers must have been there. It's like learning a new laguage, and at first you don't really know what you're saying, or if what you're saying is really the proper way to convery your message. But at a certain point, you just try, do your best, and keep practicing. Then something will click. You'll see it work, your point comes across, and it's a little easier next time. The more you do it, the more you start to see what works and what doesn't.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="play">
			<h4><strong><em>Play</em></strong></h4>
			<p>Let's be real, as frusterating as it can be, when you finally get it, you feel like the smartest kid in the room and wish you could get a <span style="color:gold">gold </span>sticker... oh wait, is that just me? What was once a struggle now becomes a small, but mighty victory. Use that momentum to get you over the next wall and eventually this success is yours! Hooray! Hey, I think maybe I've got the hang of this thing (well, until my next test of perserverance comes along)!
