			<h4>Just do it!</h4>
			<p>Maybe you're staring at what you're supposed to be coding in horror, but open up that file and start typing things in anyway. Find one little thing that you do know how to do, and get going. If you can't find anything you know how to do, pick something anyway. Once you start, it's easier to keep going--even when things go wrong.</p>

            <p>Things going wrong that you don't know how to solve leads into my next point...</p>

			<h4>Google is your best friend.</h4>
			<p>Even the best teachers have to sleep sometime. Google, though, never sleeps. If you can't figure something out, Google it, even if you don't know exactly what you're looking for. If you're lucky, you'll have searched for the right thing on the first try. If not, the results might help you figure out what keywords to use when you search again or ask a mentor for help.</p>
