			<h3>Trust Yourself</h3>
      <p>When going through your coding journey, it's going to feel a little overwhelming. You will find yourself saying "I just don't get it" but trust me, you will! All that code will look normal instewad of an alien language eventually. Just breathe.</p>
      <p>I admit I am a sufferer of imposter syndrome. I tend to overthink and talk myself into disbelief. But I am learning to trust my ability and myself in general. Once I started to remembered everybody starts at level 0 and grows, I started to calm down. Now, I can;t lie, IO still get bouts with imposter syndrome, but I am becoming more and more confident in my skills the more I keep going. Which leads me to my second piece of advice...</p>

      <h3>Practice and Repeat</h3>
      <p>The one thing I love about Skillcrush is that when you learn something, you get to practice that skill over and over again throughout the blueprint. The more you practice something and repeat it, soon it will become second nature.</p>
