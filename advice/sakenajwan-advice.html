			<h2>Coding is creative!</h2>
			<p>One of the biggest misnomers about coding is that it lacks creativity. Prior to taking the leap into web development, my understanding of programming was limited. I imagined this role to exist within an endless stream of 0s and 1s- a rigid, cold career path that required hard core computer science degrees and complicated certifications. As it turns out, my imagination and every 80s movie betrayed me. Coding is an art, and what makes it so is that it puts the coder in a trance of possibility. Developing a website is akin to sitting before an empty canvas and asking yourself: <em>How will I express myself today?</em> </p>

			<p>The vastness of programming can be daunting at first, which is why it's important to take things one step at a time. Pacing yourself through the process won't combat confusion, but the detective work that comes into play as a result adds another layer of thrill. As you hover over the enter key, you ask yourself, <em>What happens if I do this?</em> As a writer and researcher, wearing the developer hat was the first time in my professional life where I had the creative autonomy to play both artist and sleuth as a means of personal expression. </p>

			<h2>Sharing is caring.</h2>
			<p>One of my favorite things about coding is that it is collaborative. In most professional roles, ownership is what takes precedence- whether by trademark, copyright, or patent. In the developer world, junior and senior programmers take cues from an open innovation platform where ideas, feedback, and collaboration are encouraged and expected. While there are always exceptions to the rule, this approach sets the tone for acceptance, patience, and professional growth.<p>

      <h2>Google is your friend.</h2>
			<p>This may sound cliche, but I say it often. To make it plain, web development is not a skill based on memorization, but rather on your ability to access information. Tools like Google, the WordPress codex, and MDN are there to guide you when  when you're stuck on a project. As a junior developer, it's important not to be too hard on yourself for not understanding every line of code. In fact, it's healthier to embrace the fact that as a developer you'll always be a student learning and evolving with a myriad of tools, resources, and forums at your disposal.</p>
