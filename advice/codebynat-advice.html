			<h4>Ask lots of questions</h4>
			<p>If you're completely new to coding it can be intimidating to aks those "stupid" questions.  Don't hesitate.  The help is there.  And you may actually be one of dozens wondering the same thing.  Use those resources!  The instructors/facilitators are super helpful and quick to reply.  </p>

			<h4>Stick with it</h4>
			<p>Being a stay-at-home parent for a kid who's struggling with health issues is tough.  Schedule is unpredictable at best and at worst you're exhausted and stressed out.  Missing classes, going days without seeming to make any progress, or just not having time/energy to even THINK about your classes is demoralizing.  Don't give up.  Use the time you do have to the best of your abilities and stay positive.  It is all part of getting stronger and doing what it takes.  Believe that all this effort will be rewarded!</p>
