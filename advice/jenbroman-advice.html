			<h4>First, set yourself up for success</h4>
			<p>Set aside an hour each day for coding. Not watching tutorials or reading about coding. Actual.coding. Every.single.day. Preferably at the same time. For me that's along with my coffee in the morning.</p>

			<p>If you can practice facing a blank screen and writing code every day you will gain traction fast.</p>

			<h4>Confusion means the learning process is working!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you're doing something new. It's almost as if your brain can only hold so much at first. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before. One way to keep going when you hit the wall of "not-getting-it" is to switch from focused learning to diffused learning.  So step away from the keyboard, go for a walk - or just do something entirely different and let your brain process the learning for a little while.  Quite often, the answer to your problem will pop up when you're letting your mind "rest". This little trick has helped me so much and saved lots of time!</p>

			<p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
