		<h1>Hi, my name is Cynthia C. and I have some advice for you!</h1>

			<h4>Ask for help</h4>
			<p>When you get stuck and can't move on, your Skillcrush instructors are there to help you. Your questions get answered in no time.  Ask questions in the MightyBell circles. Your fellow students may be struggling with the same problem.  Maybe someone else has already solved it, and can give you a hand. You'll never know unless you ask.  Or just </p> 
			<h4>Be patient and compassionate with yourself!</h4>
			<p>When learning to code as well as programming, I had no idea of what it all entails, what it all meant! Everything was brand new to me.  Sometimes, I would become so frustrated with myself because I felt like it wasn't clicking and just wanted to give up. But I managed to keep pushing through.</p>
			<p>In order to survive, you have to learn how to be patience with yourself.  Learning to relax, laugh at yourself, and not getting overly excited can get you through stressful times.  So just be compassionate with yourself because at the end of the day you need you will understand what you are doing. So, take your time, learn the concepts, and ask plenty of questions.</p>
			<p> Before you realize it everything will not be a blur and things will finally come together.
			<h4>Use on-line resources</h4>
			<p>Use online resources like <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a>.  They cover just about every aspect of HTML and CSS, and they provide a practice area where you can try things yourself and see immediate results.  You can search for a term and find the reference page for it quickly and easily.</p>
			<h4>Don't give up!</h4>
			<p>Never, never, never give up even though learning to code is challenging.  It's like learning a new language.  Just stick to it, and you'll find it gets easier with time.</p>
			<h4>Practice, practice, Practice!!!</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology or programming language there is never enough practice.  Practice when you are learning, practice for understanding, and practice to see if things could be done more efficiently.  The more you practice, it aids in your knowledge of understanding exactly what is happening and why its happening.</p>

		    <h4>Finally, always take  mini breaks, and come back refreshed and energized! You'll be feeling great all day! <img src="http://pix.iemoji.com/images/emoji/apple/8.3/256/smiling-face-with-heart-shaped-eyes.png" alt= "Feeling energized! height="40" width="40"/> </h4>
