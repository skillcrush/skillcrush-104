			<h4>Google it!</h4>
			<p>When learning to code, there are so many recources online. I find almost all the answers I have questions to by doing a Google search.</p>

			<p>Learning a new language can be hard, but it's fun too, becuase it challenges you in ways that you may have not experienced in a very long time. Especially for those of us who are making a career change to something compeltely new.</p>

			<h4>Practice makes perfect.</h4>
			<p>Be paitent with yourself. You will get there. Make a daily practice of spening 15 minutes coding.</p>
