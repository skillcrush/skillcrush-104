        <h2>Don't Doubt Your Abilities and Your Intelligence</h2>
            
                <p>For years I've wanted to learn how to program and I put it 
                    off, following a different career path. This was because I
                    was convinced I either wasn't smart enough or that I was 
                    'too far behind'. I thought I didn't have the 
                    math/logic/science background I would need to keep up.</p>
            
                <p>I have recently found out that all of the above is bull****.                    
                     You don't have to be a genius to code, but you do have to be 
                    willing to think about things differently than you're used to. 
                    You need to trust yourself, and forgive yourself. Both things
                    that are hard for many. Oh, and about the math thing? Please 
                    read <a href="http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2014/07/15/programming-is-not-math/">
                    Programming is Not Math</a> by the great <a href="http://saragmei.com">Sara Mei</a></p>
            
            <h2>Go Out, Take Chances and Meet People</h2>
            
                <p>I'll admit that I am a perfectionist. I didn't want to tell anyone that I was interested in coding until I
                      knew enough to 'talk the talk'. I have a feeling many developers/devs in training feel this way.
                      While it can be a positive trait- we teach ourselves so much it is beyond enough- it can also be stifling. 
                      </p>
                <p>Go meet people before you are ready. Tell them you want to learn more about coding. Apply for scholarships, go to meet-ups
            , go to hackathons, join Twitter. I went to RailsConf last year as a total n00b and was shocked at how supportive people
            were of people starting out. It made me regret a little not going to meet-ups sooner. Stick your neck out-someone will see it.</p>
