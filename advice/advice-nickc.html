			<h2>Practice, practice, practice</h2>
			<p>My main advice is to keep practicing at coding. You will fail. A lot. The only way I managed to improve was to keep working at it.</p>
			<h2>Look Stuff Up</h2>
			<p>There are many resources for coding online. Use them. Chances are that someone else has had the same problem or issue that you have had</p>
			<h2>Take Breaks</h2>
			<p>It might seem counterproductive, but whenever I feel like I can't figure out the solution to a problem, I take a break. It helps clear
			my head. I feel like I am able to look at the problem differently than I had before.</p>
