			<h4>Embrace the Errors!</h4>
			<p>You'll make a lot of them... and that's ok. The trick is to recognize that this is a part of the learning process, and therefore a good thing. It's not failure.
			<p>In fact, each mistake teaches you something new and valuable... rote memorization of facts does no such thing. If you aren't making mistakes, you aren't challenging yourself. If you aren't challenging yourself, you aren't learning.</p>

			<h4>Learn From More Than One Source.</h4>
			<p>Every now and then you'll hit a point where nothing seems to be sinking in. Things that <em>should</em> make perfect sense... don't. This happens, and it's a normal part of the learning process. What it means is that your brain needs time to sort through all of that information.</p>

			<p>This doesn't mean you need take a long, unhappy, unproductive break. Quite the opposite! Your brain simply needs to move over to a temporarily different teching method. There are many ways to learn code out there, whether it be a practical, hands-on training site like Free Code Camp, a learning game site like CodeCombat, a full course, or even a book.</p>

			<p>Use one of these tools to allow yourself to see the same subject from a different standpoint. Then go back to your primary learning method and watch how much more your brain is able to take in. You've given your mind a rest without sacrificing learning time!</p>

 			<h4>Just. Have. Fun.</h4>
			<p>Learning to code means learning to solve new and unique puzzles. Everyone likes puzzles. They can be frustrating, sure, but the end result always brings a sense of fulfillment, one of confidence. The same holds true with coding. Reminding yourself of that will keep you going when things get tough.</p>

			<p>...and admit it: sometimes the mistakes we make are pretty darned funny. Go ahead and laugh at your mistakes. You know that you'll eventually fix them, after all, and the act of laughing reduces stress levels, which in turn, reduces the amount of time you spend fretting over something that turns out to be nothing more than a mis-typed character or a missing div tag.</p>
