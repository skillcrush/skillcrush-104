			<h4>Don't give up!</h4>
			<p>Sometimes it's going to be hard and you are going to feel like walking away but don't give up! I have definitely hit a few blocks along the way so far, doubted myself a lot, thought to myself maybe I am not clever enough to do this. But then I have to think, if it was easy everyone would be doing it! </p>

			<p>So I have learned to not be so hard on myself, I can do it and I will do it. If I need a break I am going to take it and if I fall behind I am not going to panic or stress because I will catch up and I will get there and all of this will be worth it!</p>

			<h4>Look at how far you've come</h4>
			<p>Following on from my previous advice of not giving up, when things are tough, you are finding things difficult or even if you just have a spare minute, sometimes you just have to stop and see how far you have come. I look back and think wow I can do that and I learned how to do this, all in the space of a few weeks...that's pretty amazing!</p>

			<p>So I like me, give yourself a big pat on the back for how far we've come and just think in another few weeks all the other cool things that we'll will be able to do!</p>
