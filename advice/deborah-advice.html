			<h4>Keep persevering!</h4>
			<p>Learning to code is hard but don't give up. You may not grasp some of the concepts straight away but keep plugging away.
			And sometimes you just need to take a little break and when you come back to the problem the solution becomes clear</p>

			<h4>Use your resources!</h4>
			<p>Google, classmates, podcasts, local meet-ups - use them all. It's ok to ask for help.  </p>
			
			<h4>Take notes!</h4>

			<p>Taking notes helps you to retain information. Take time to go back over the lessons even though its tempting to speed through everything.</p>
