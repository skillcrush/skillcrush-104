			<h4>Don't be discouraged!</h4>
			<p>Sometimes it takes a while to get the hang of how coding works and the only way to really learn is to practice.</p>

			<p>There are bugs in every program! Debugging programs can be difficult but I think it's super important for you to try to find bugs on your own when you are first learning.  Try not to rely on tools to find your errors.  This will help you really learn how code works and will help you learn syntax. </p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
