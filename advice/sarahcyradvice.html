			<h4>Embrace the Unknown</h4>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

			<p>What I must keep telling myself is that confusion is normal and everything cannot be memorized. Researching for the answers is key. There is no shame in finding out what other developers have solved.</p>

			<h4>Be Kind to Yourself and the Rest will Follow</h4>
			<p>Looking back I learned so much in the past 2 months! Things are beginning to stick and I don't have to be a perfectionist in order to ship a project. I have to remember to take care of my body and mental health as well. Take frequent breaks to recharge, get good food and plenty of exercise so my ability to code will persevere.</p>


			<p class="footnote">Don't worry about what might be, but look forward to possibilities.</p>
