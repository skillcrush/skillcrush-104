			<h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
			<p>You are not going to know everything in a day. Be okay with the fact that learning takes time and it is so very worth it in the end. Be patient with yourself and regularly reflect on how much you've learned so far whenever you feel confused. Remind yourself that you'll get it. </p>
