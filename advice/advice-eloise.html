            <h5>Double Check Your Work</h5>
            <p>It's something you've heard from the very beginning of English class back in elementary school but maybe you feel you've surpassed that point. You're not in school anymore so why should you need to edit or revise?</p>

            <p>Don't get cocky. Editing and revising your work is not a concept that only applies to a specific age group. The idea is not a personal affront to your style or your smarts. Return to your work so you can make it the best it can be.</p>

            <p>Do not brush over it with glazed eyes. Take a break if you need one but don't sacrifice the ultimate quailty of your work by rushing through this potential last step. Ease through it with a fine-tooth comb until each semicolon is standing in its correct place and each indent is aligned with its sisters.</p>
