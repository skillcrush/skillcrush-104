			<h4>Thoughts on badassery</h4>
			<p>As important as trusting you gut is to learn to resist your resistance, this is where you'll be able to solve mysteries, questions, and even overcome personal blocks that have kept you from doing other things, things you actually enjoy.</p>

			<p>There will be plenty of opportunities to test your self and get to know yourself from another angle you don't see very often. This whole thing is a personal challenge, it's about you, your capabilities and surprising no one but yourself. </p>

			<h4>It's never enough</h4>
			<p>No matter how many new things you learned in the last six months, this tech world is an infinite space of possibilities and things to learn, and it'll keep you humble and excited.</p>

			<p>It's also very important to take breaks and let concepts sync in, by now you should know that your brain loves to marinate concepts before actually being able to play with them, so don't put too much pressure on you it, and feed it other subjects, and it'll be eternally grateful.  </p>

			<p>Time is nothing but your friend, as long as you keep a consistent practise, all concepts will eventually make sense in your ehad and on-screen.</p>
