			<h4>Don't Give UP!</h4>
			<p>You are learnings something new. It will be hard, and challenging, and rewarding. When it is hard you may want to give up. Don't! When it is challenging, you will want to give up. Don't! When it is rewarding you will realize why you didn't give up.</p>

			<h4>When you fall behind don't give up.</h4>
			<p>If you are like me life sometimes gets in the way of learning new things. Or new shiny things get in the way of continueing to learn things. When you fall behind, it may be easy to give up because you are behind and there is so much to do in order to catch up. Take a deep breath and recommit to the process. Skillcrush is broken down into manageable lessons. Take it one lesson at a time. If time allows for two lessons, take them one at a time. Just keep breathing. Nothing is too difficult when you break it down in to steps and work through it one step or lesson at a time. </p>

			<h4>You will make mistakes.</h4>

			<p>You are learning something new. You will make mistakes. If you aren't makeing mistakes you probably aren't learning or challenging yourself. Some mistakes are easy to fix but hard to find. Sometimes just stepping away from a problem will help. Sometimes you can use the google to find your error. If all else fails ask for help, your classmates and instructors are here to help you. But don't give up. Never Give Up! </p>
