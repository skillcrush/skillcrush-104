			<h2>I've wanted to code for a couple of years.</h2>
			<p>I've worked at several different marketing and SEO agencies, but there was one common theme in all those jobs. I was working in social media and content management, but I wanted to be working with the developers!</p>

			<p>But I've seen <b>SO</b> much age discrimination in the workforce, that I was afraid to even try learning to code. What was the point? I don't have a Computer Science background, and I'm in my late 40's. I was afraid it would be a major waste of time to even try.</p>

			<h2>That's "Rear Admiral Hopper" to you.</h2>
			<p>Then I started learning about all these code schools that opened programming up to everyone. And THEN I learned about an incredible woman. <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/grace-hopper-21406809">Rear Admiral Grace Hopper</a>.</p>

			<p>She was a non-traditional <i>everything!</i> And if she can break all the conventions in pursuit and furtherance of what she truly enjoyed and was so incredibly good at, then, my sisters, so can WE. </p>
