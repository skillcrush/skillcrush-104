			<h4>Remeber you are learning</h4>
			<p>Remember that you are learning and and go easy on yourself. If you don't understand something, look for the answer. There are plenty of resources and the act of looking up your problem and finding the solution helps you understand.</p>

			<p>The satisfaction that you get from figuring out a problem that has been plaguing you is so rewarding. It makes you feel like you can do anything and makes the learning process so much more fun.</p>

			<h4>Find a community</h4>
			<p>Trying to learn a new technology on your own feels like a daunting task. But you aren't really alone! There are plenty of people out there who are learning too or people who have already run into the roadblocks that you are hitting and they are willing to help. </p>

			<p>Take advantage of all the resources that are out there. There are so many places to look for help and they are usually pretty easy to find. Any problem I have had has been resloved fairly quickly because of the resources that are so readily available.</p>
