			<h4>Learning isn't a straight path</h4>
			<p>Out of the blue you'll go from knowing the last topic inside out and feeling like you're on trac to being utterly lost.</p>

			<p>That's ok, and the process of trying to learn where you're going wrong probably helps you retain the info better in the long run.</p>

			<h4>Nothing is perfect</h4>
			<p>There isn't always one correct anserr to a problem, someone else's code might not look exactly like yours. Learn from everyone else and use their code to see how they approached the same problem. </p>

			<p>The race was won by the turtle, not the hare.</p>
