			<h2>"Am I Really Cut Out for This?"</h2>

			<p>This was the thought continuously going through my head when I first began this class. I wondered if i'd actually be able to catch on and understand what I was doing, instead of just knowing how to go through the motions. I wondered if i'd ever truly be able to make money with this since that was my end goal so that I could stay home with my newborn son, instead of having to go to work everyday.</p>

			<p>I have indeed had a few setbacks; a few misadventures, but each situation that I have been in has truly helped me learn something new, so they weren't without their positive attributes! I sincerely enjoy learning something new, so I continue to press on, even though I have wanted to give up more than a few times..</p>

			<h2>Press Forward, Never Fall Back!</h2>

		    <p>In the midst of my classes, I had a baby. A beautiful, bouncing baby boy named Roman, and he is the light of my life and he the reason why I came back to continue pushing forward with this class! He is the reason that I am here in the first place, flexing my technological muscles and working towards financial freedom for my family!</p>

			<p>The best part of this all? I was a dancer in my past life who drew, painted and sang, so to be honest, i've never really been one to use this side of my brain! It makes it all the more worthwhile since it is a challenge to myself and if/once I succeed, I hope to inspire right-brained individuals just like me to give coding a try!</p>

			<p>In conclusion, I come at coding everyday just like I approach parenting a young child for the first time: One day and one step at a time. That is really all that I can do, so I will continue to do it well.</p>
