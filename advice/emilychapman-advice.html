			<h4>You can learn thisâ€”I promise</h4>
			<p>If you don't have a traditional technical background, you may feel like hard tech is Beyond Your Understanding. It's not. If you could learn math in high school, you can learn the basic bits and bobs of Python or Ruby or HTML or whatever now. The key is to find someone who actually wants to teach you, and won't make you feel dumb when you're learning.</p>
