			<h4><strong>Take things step by step!</strong></h4>
			<p>Learning to code is like learning a new language and can be overwhelming at first glance. You may be tempted to do things quickly, looking for instant gratification. Hold your horses there, bub.</p>

			<p>Learning things slowly and properly the first time, and getting into good habits early will benefit you more in the long run than learning things too quickly. Building skills on a solid foundation is key. Patience is a virtue indeed!</p>

			<h4>Keep at it!</h4>
			<p>You might get stuck on one tiny problem for hours. But! If ever you feel stuck, fear not. Resources are everywhere! From blogs online to other programmers, don't be afraid to look for help if you can't figure things out on your own.</p>

			<p>Overcoming a problem is always so fantastic and rewarding! Keep practicing and keep at it, and you'll get there!</p>
