			<h4>Carpe diem!</h4>
			<p>What? Crappy dimes? No, <em>carpe diem!</em> It means "seize the day" in Latin.</p>

			<p>If an opportunity comes up, and you want to take it, then take it! Especially if you have some idea already of what your expenses are.</p>

			<h4>Life is short.</h4>
			<p>We only get a certain amount of time on this Earth, so we need to make it memorable with the resources we have.</p>

			<p>Apply for that dream job even if you don't get it. Go on a cruise in the Bahamas. Explore a new part of the world, or try octopus! Whatever you consider new and exciting, go for it! Because you never know when you won't have that chance again.</p>
