			<h4>Organization is key</h4>
			<p>The cleaner your code is, the easier it'll be for you to find everything,
				so comment on you code often and indent when necessary!</p>

			<h4>Git, Github and The Command Line</h4>
			<p>They could be extremely confusing at first, but I think it's <Strong>very important</strong>
				to get familiarized with them early while learning how to code.</p>
