			<h4>There is no such thing as a silly question!</h4>
			<p>It's likely that someone has gone through the exact same problem as you before, so there's no need to stew over it for hours.. ask the question!</p>

			<h4>Go away and come back...</h4>
			<p>Sometimes moving away from the screen and coming back to it with fresh eyes can be really helpful. I've had many eureka moments away from the computer!</p>

			<h4>Don't get overwhelmed!</h4>

			<p>Sometimes if I've looked too far ahead into the 'coding world' I've become very overwhelmed with how little I know and how far I've got to go. Take each step at a time, focusing on the task at hand and you will make the progress! Everyone was a beginner at one time :) </p>
