			<h4>Lessons Learned!</h4>
			
			<p>I am stealing this right out of project management discipline. When you start out you will many mistakes. You will spend (waste?) so much time figuring out how to solve them. You will try lots of things but finally you will find something that WORKS!</p>

			<p>Keep some sort of journal/table/record of problems encountered and the solution so that next time (there will almost definitely be a next time!) You will know where to go to find the solution. This also helps to cement those solutions in your head. Similar problems will pop up and seemingly automatically you will recognize certain types of problems, and easily recall solutions.</p>

			<p>Remember to go back once and a while to old problems and update them with better solutions that you will inevitably find</p>
			
			<h4>Google is your friend! Learn the valuable art of Google Fu</h4>
			
			<p>By far the most used tool to help when you just aren't sure of something, even when you are completely clueless, just Google it</p>

			<p>You will at times not even know what to google. Take a wild stab at something, and as you quickly scan some results you can keep doing new searches and refining, eventually narrowing in on what you are looking for. Like any skill, practice is key. You will get better and faster the more you do this.</p>

			<p>There are other good places to look but they will most likely pop up in a google search</p>
			
			<p>Always pay attention to the date or age of the post/reply. There is a lot of old questions and answers. Some are specific to a certain version or older release and sometimes they just will not work. Better solutions and features introduced since are likely</p>
			
			<h4>Code every day</h4>
			
			<p>Even if it is just 15 minutes some days.</p>
