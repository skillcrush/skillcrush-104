			<h4>Learning is a Journey!</h4>
			<p>This is all new, the first time you are seeing code and software development.</p>

      <p>You may feel overwhelmed at times. You can take breaks and come back to the material with fresh eyes.</p>

			<p>The most important thing is that you are learning. </p>
