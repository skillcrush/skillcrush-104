			<h4>Dive in the water is great!</h4>
			<p>Most people thing coding is only for the hyper intelligent, introverted guy that never goes outside. This is plainly not true! Coding helps express creativity and can automatize the everyday monotonous tasks.</p>

			<p>I spents days researching the right language to learn and it didn't end up mattering. You will continuously be asked to learn new languages and systems, but not let that stress you out because the coding community is a sharing one. Every question has resources online to figure it out and if you know a developer typically they are happy to help out a newbie coder with any questions you may have. If they aren't there are plenty of other that are willing to help.</p>

			<h4>So what are you waiting for?!</h4>
			<p>Just create something, anything! You'll be hooked! A great community, puzzles for eons, and the sense of accomplishment is immensely rewarding.</p>
