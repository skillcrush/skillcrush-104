			<h4>Each Obsticle is a Choice!</h4>
			<p>One of the most attractive things about coding for me was the availability of information while I was working. If I run into a problem and I need an answer, I'm already at my computer ready to find it. </p>

			<p>You will never truly stop learning code. It is an ever evolving field that keeps you on your toes. So when you run into a problem that stumps you, its important to make the choice to actually LEARN how to fix it. Not just copy paste the answer.</p>

			<h4>Take a Breath, Give Yourself Time.</h4>
			<p>Running into a problem can be really frustrating when you're just starting out. Especially if you're really busy. But always try to stop, and take a breath, and give yourself some time to actually learn from your mistakes. You deserve to improve!</p>

			<p>There is nothing wrong with copying and pasting code to create a shortcut, just be sure you understand how the shortcut works before you use it.</p>

			<p>I always say to myself, "yes, you're busy. But you are never too busy to work on yourself. You deserve the satisfaction of understanding the solution."</p>
