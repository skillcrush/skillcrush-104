			<h4>No one knows everything.</h4>
			<p>When I first started coding, I assumed advanced coders just KNEW all there was to know. They had it all memorized. And that if I wanted to be an advanced coder, I also had to memorize everything. It was somehow cheating to use reference material.</p>

			<p>NOPE.</p>
			
			<p>No one has all that stuff memorized, because there's no need to. You memorize the process, the concept, the strategy. But you don't have to memorize every color hex code, or every single way to style a font. That's what google is for. If you understand how and why, you can look up the small details to make it happen.</p>
