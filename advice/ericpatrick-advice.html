      <h4>Don't Go at This Alone</h4>
      <p>Learning technical skills are hard. There are many resources online to read, but there's nothing like honest feedback. You don't have to physically connect with someone. It could be over the internet. But be sure that someone is checking not only your work but holding you accountable and vice versa.</p>

      <h4>Frustration is Inevitable</h4>
      <p>Learning how to code is literally like learning a new language. That's why they are called programming languages (duh). If you know more than one language, ask yourself, "What did it take for me to master this second, third, or fourth language?" If you don't know more than, think about what it would take to learn one. Apply that same zeal to learning how to code and don't let things get in your way. Pracetice, practice, and practice some more.</p>
