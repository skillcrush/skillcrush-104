			<h4>Imposter syndrome is real but manageable.</h4>
			<p>When I landed my first web design related gig I felt like I didn't deserve it at first because I didn't have a computer science
			degree and had just completed the Skillcrush HTML and CSS course. However the gig paid well and I realized I wasn't making much money
		and so I needed to take a chance. Long story short, take opportunities when they come. </p>
			<h4>Never underestimate the importance of learning tech skills.</h4>
			<p>As someone who majored in philosophy and Africana Studies and studied music extensively in college, I came out with few jobs
			related to my fields of study. People were telling me about the importance of learning tech skills and at first I didn't listen
		but then I realized how short I was on money and realized if I wanted to make money to buy a new cello case, to afford an accompanist
	for music gigs I needed to learn new marketable skills. Learning tech skills is for everyone, and even as a humanities arts person I
have really benefitted from coding. I not only can market my skills from my fields of study, such
as writing and critical thinking but also combine them with skills in web development. </p>
			<p> Everyone can benefit from learning tech skills.
			<h4> Never give up. </h4>
			<p> There were many times I thought I wouldn't finish my Skillcrush courses. I got frustrated when taking
				the Visual Design course because I had creative's block and couldn't design anything artistic in Photoshop. My final project
				for the course ended up being a flop, but I learned to keep going. The philosopher and educator Daisaku Ikeda says
				"even if things don't unfold the way you expected, don't be disheartened or give up. One who continues to advance
				will win in the end." (http://www.ikedaquotes.org/strength/strength352.html?quotes_start=7>)</p>
			<h4> Take breaks </h4>
			<p> Learning anything new can be a challenge, so a lot of times now I take a break and practice my cello or read a book
				when I come across something that is difficult to understand. When you take breaks, you run less risk of burning out and you also
				continue to have fun when you code. </p>
			<h4> It's ok to ask questions. </h4>
			<p> When I first started Skillcrush I didn't feel the need to ask questions, even on material I struggled with.
				During the Visual Design course I often avoided emailing the instructors about questions I had on the material because
				I was embarrassed about my own work and somehow assumed they would judge me. But then I requested a feedback session with one of
				the instructors and she was very understanding. Your instructors have dealt with similar challenges so they encourage you
				to ask for help so you don't feel like you are alone. For the Git and Git Hub course I have begun to ask more questions and the
				instructors have been so helpful. Asking questions also shows humility, that you are willing to not accept things at face value.
				So yes, ask questions when you are stuck. And hey, someone else might have had the same question but was also too afraid to ask, so
				you're encouraging other people to open up about their questions too. </p>
