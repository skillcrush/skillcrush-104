			<h4>Focus on your own understanding, instead of comparing</h4>
			
			<p>When I started my bachelors, I did not know almost anything about programming, while some of my 
				(raised as male*) classmates had some prior experience and did not get tired of showing 
				off or talk badly about somebody else's work. Many of my (raised as female*) 
				classmates were therefore demotivated rather fast, because we found ourselves in a 
				situation where it was hard to "overtake" the others quickly and it was hard to become part of the best. 
				The conclusion of many was that they "were just not good at this" or even that they "did not like it".</p>
				
				<p>I find this a pity, as there is so much to gain from programming and I certainly think that it would 
					have been possible to get good in it for a majority of my classmates, if they had not been confronted 
					with all the showing off behavior of some classmates.</p>
					
				<p>Therefore my advice would be: try to forget about other people as much as possible (especially mansplaining ones). 
					Do not compare to them, but focus on your own understanding. It is your own thing and they have nothing to do with it.</p>
					
					<h4>In the end it is not important for us how we started, but that we do what we want to do. </h4>
					<p>If others are you intimedating you, try to acknowledge that as a disturbing factor. Take inspiration from them only as far as helpful. Do not let it keep you from learning and experimenting yourself.
						 Make use of the online world or try to group up with people who support you.
					Like female* coding collectives- there is often a great atmosphere for starting out on it. I think it is really important to believe in yourself here. 
					You are NOT alone. </p>
