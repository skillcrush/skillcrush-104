			<h4>Do, or Do Not. There is No Try</h4>
			<p>OK, so Yoda maybe wasn't a programmer, but the advice is the same. Just get started. I have a full time job and a child and the time I have on hand to study varies from week-to-week.</p>
            
            <p>It doesnt matter.</p>
        
            <p>Just keep going and before you know it, you will have learned more than you can imagine.</p>
            
            <p>At my current pace, it may be a while for I am ready for a programming job. But each day I get a little closer. I am playing the long game and will NOT be deterred.</p>
