			<h4>Embrace the Learning Curve!</h4>
			<p>When you start learning how to code, you will run into code issues syntax, semantics, concepts, etc that you simply won't understand and will have a terrible time grasping.</p>

			<p>Embrace the learning curve! The most important thing to remember is that you are learning a new language, and like any other language mastery only comes through lots of practice and making a lot of mistakes. Instead of giving up when things become difficult, press on! At a certain point, things will start to click and you'll start to understand the whys and the hows of the language you are working on!

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
