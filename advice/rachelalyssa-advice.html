			<h4>You're not going to be good at everything!</h4>
			<p>When you start learning you will not always be good at everything. I have an insane need to be good at everything I do. When something doesn't click for me it honestly frustrates me.</p>
			<p>I am not good at everything already, but when it came to tech things I just assumed I would be. While I do well with actual tech stuff design is a hard concept for me to grasp. So just remember, you will not be good at everything....right away at least. That is why we are here. To learn.</p>

			<h4>Step away if you need to.</h4>
			<p>Something I always forget is the need to get away from a new task time to time and just take a break. Especially if you're getting upset and just feel you can't grasp something, let it go for a while and come back to it. Read a book, watch a show, spend time with family or anything else you might enjoy. Just get away.</p>

			<p>It is easy to become obsessive when you first start something, but just make sure it doesn't completely consume your life. If you have nothing else then there will be no way to destress when the task at hand becomes overwhelming, trust me I let it happen all too often. Stress can be a killer if you are not careful. So if and when you need to step away. Take a break, take a breath and come back later once you're calm and level-headed.</p>

			<h4>Ask for help!</h4>
			<p>I am the worst at asking for help, but I mean it. When you need help, ask for it. You can also do searching, but do not be afraid to ask for help. Sometimes the answer is easy and you might feel silly when you realize that, but it doesn't hurt to ask. It can be worse for your self-esteem to let a problem consume you and break you down.</p>

			<p>This may not be something I really should be giving advice on since I will tend to always search for my answer rather than asking questions, but that is me sort of set in my ways. I just want to make sure that others realize that it is not necessary. They can ask questions. You are not dumb because you do. It simply means that there may be a better way for you to understand a technique or information. The way it is currently being presented is just not vibing with you and that is okay. Tech is a collaborative effort. Don't be afraid.</p>
