			<h4>Make it a habit!</h4>
			<p>Okay, maybe I DID get this advice when I started, but it never hurts to hear it again.  Especially if you didn't believe it the first time! Now, it may not look like sitting down every evening at 7:05pm and working for exactly an hour an a half, but the key is for coding to become a given in your day (or week if that's what your schedule allows).  Ask yourself, "When am I going to code today/this week?" not "Am I gonna work on that course this week?" or even "I should really work on that this week."</p>

			

			<h4>Take notes</h4>
			<p>Maybe I'm just a bit old school, but I still takes notes - lots of notes! Useful pieces of code, key commands, concepts, workflows - I write it all down.  Coding isn't easy, not matter what language you're learning, you're learning a new language - or a few - and there's no way your brain can hold all that info with out a few things falling out. So, do yourself a favor and listen to what all the learning experts recommend and take some long hand (yes, with a pen and paper - it's scientifically proven to be better than typed notes for recall) notes as you learn all that new techy knowledge.</p>

			<h4>Google It.</h4>

			<p>If you come to a problem, bug, or conundrum while coding, sit with it for a bit - try a few things, play with it, but not for too long.  I wish someone had told me at the beginning that google was not the easy way out, but an essential resource for anyone learning to code, especially if you're doing it virtually.  If you haven't figured out a problem after 15 or 20 minutes, don't just give up and tell yourself you'll never hack it as a developer, just hop on google and ask your question - I can guarantee you that thousands of other people have had your same issue or question and there are whole websites dedicated to answering your coding questions!</p>
