					<h2>Stay Motivated</h2>
						<p>It can be a challenge to keep up the momentum especially when encountering learning curves. Some keys to staying motivated are... 
							<ul> 
								<li>Visualizing your ultimate goal.</li>
								<li>Making a list of reasons why you're doing what you're doing.</li>
								<li>Breaking down your goal into smaller steps.</li>
								<li>Having a strategy to reach your goal, but being prepared to change tactics.</li>
								<li>Pre-determining how you will deal with lack of motivation!</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p> In the words of Winston Churchill, "Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, give up!" And remember to enjoy the journey, even if it's slow at times!</p>

					<h2>Learn By Doing</h2>
						<p> Fear of mistakes can prevent us from jumping in and learning new things. Don't let that happen in your journey learning code! As the old saying goes, "use it or lose it". The sooner you start playing with code, the faster you will learn the given concept.</p>
						<p>So make it a practice to practice the code as you go through the material. An example of this could be building a personal project using new syntaxes you're learning. </p>
