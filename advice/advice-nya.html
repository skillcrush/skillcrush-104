			<h4>Don't be afraid to break things!</h4>
			<p>When you start programming in a new position at a company do not become too afraid to take challenges on that make you uncomfortable.  Find a company with a coding environment that encourages growth.  If not you are not lucky enough to find this type of culture make sure that you continue to code on your own at home so that you can continue to explore and experiment.</p>
