			<h4>You Are Learning Coding, NOT How To Google Search</h4>
			<p>The first course I took in coding was a JavaScript course that would do a so-so job at explaining a principle of JavaScript and then ask you to solve a scenario WAY BEYOND what they have taught. The first few challenges I got through, but I spent days Googling how to do things, and it took an even longer time to find what I was looking for because I didn't know the proper terminology for what I wanted to do in "coder speak". If you find yourself spending days Googling how to do something, and you are still having problems, don't get down on yourself for finding a different source for the information you seek (in the scenario above, it was learning JavaScript). I stayed way to long looking to complete a level 7 task when I was a level 2, and once I switched to a better learning environment FOR ME, I learned a lot more and it was a much more fun experience.</p>

			<h4>Stress, Challenge, Getting Help and Early Warning Signs</h4>
			<p>A certain degree of challenging material is a good thing when learning something new. It should be challenging, but not frustrating. It is especially helpful to pay attention to your frustration levels in the midst of learning. Some of this frustration is from not knowing where to look to fix something (like those darn semicolons) but sometimes it has to do with reaching out for help. If a course does not have a place to ask questions, I would say that is a course that will be more frustrating than educational if it is too challenging. A good teacher or mentor can transform a challenge into a valuable learning experience.</p>
			
			<h4>Finding the Sweet Spot</h4>
			<p>So ultimately, you want to find the balance between challenge (so that you learn and stay interested) and ease (so that the learning experience stays fun and fulfilling). It is a balance, and if you monitor that balance as you move along in your coding education, you should be able to stick with it and grow quickly into an excellent developer.</p>
