			<h4>You Will Get Frustrated</h4>
			<p>At times, while learning to code you'll feel like what you're doing is near impossible. You'll get frustrated with the code and sometimes yourself. These are the moments where you'd like to give up, but you can't do that to yourself. </p>

			<p>When we were babies learning how to walk, we would fall. What would we do after falling though? That's right, we'd get back up and try again. Once we tired out, we rested and ate. As soon as we got enough energy again, we'd be back on the grind trying to get our stubby legs strong enough to walk on our own. We have to apply the same principles here when learning to code. </p>

			<h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
