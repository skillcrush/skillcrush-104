			<h4>Coding Can Be Daunting!</h4>
			<p>When you begin learning to code, it can be scary. You're dedicating your free time to something you've never done before and maybe not sure will pay off.</p>
			<p>But trust me, it will be worth it! This process can be very rewarding when you dedicate yourself to it. It feels so good when you start to fully grasp your lessons and tasks.</p>
			<h4>Believe In Yourself!</h4>
			<p>This process will not work if you don't believe in yourself. Try not to get frustrated and just keep trying when you don't get something and ask for help. NO ONE gets everything their first time around and no one can learn all of this on their own.</p>

			<p>Takeaway: always ask for help when you need it. And don't be afraid to repeat lessons and step away when you need a break.</p>

			<p>You are going to be a badass coder. Just keep working towards that goal!!!</p>
