			<h4>Repeat after me: "I believe in work, hard work."</h4>
				<p>Yes, that's part of my alma mater's - Auburn University - creed, but it's always something that I say when I start something challenging. And, my course - Front End Development -  has been quite a challenge! I started this course knowing enough HTML and CSS to be dangerous on the back end of a development platform, or at least thinking I knew something about it. But, I had never heard of Git Hub, or HTML5, or ever collaborated with anyone with code. I quickly discovered my knowledge was beginner level, at best. </p>

				<p>But that's why you are here. To learn. Continue to remind yourself that this is work. Or, preparing you for better/different work. It, in many instances, is hard work. There were some things I just didn't really understand. Or, I thought while watching the video, "Gee, that's simple" only to discover I couldn't remember what tag or command line was supposed to come next. It takes repetition, and if you practice enough, it will start to become a whole lot simpler for you. I promise. </p>

				<p>Keep in mind nothing - when you first try it - is easy. Maybe sometimes you get lucky and get it right, or you can fake it for a while, but it's so important to have a good base understanding. There's a whole world out there full of tags, and commenting, and brackets. And, there's a way to tweak those things to look beautiful on any type of screen. That's what you are going to learn to do - to craft a creative piece of content to your liking.</p>  

				<p>I also want to encourage you to take a moment and look at the handouts and cheatsheets they provided. They are a huge help. If you can learn what's on those sheest, you will be coasting through some of those lessons. Looking back, I wish I would have taken more time to look at them, and not rushed to the next video or challenge.</p>


			<h4>Most importantly, don't be discouraged.</h4>
				<p> It's easy to do. But don't. Remember why you are here. Know that people with super basic coding skills like me have made it. And remember there are simple little victories along the way. It really can be invigorating when you begin to refresh your page and see the changes you made or you get a 100% on the quiz. Even when it's small, simple tweaks or a few easy questions, you can't help but smile a little.
				</p>
				<p> And, if you are feeling a little lost, head over to your group hangouts. There is probably someone there who is struggling with the same thing you are, or they might just have some handy tips for you to learn. You aren't supposed to know all the answers, but need to have the willingness to try to find them. Don't be shy!</p>
