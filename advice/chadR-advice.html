                <h4>Follow Your Interests</h4>
                <p>As with any new commitment you make as an adult we always have to evaluate if learning something new is worth our time. Life is busy and almost everyone has to balance many responsibilities such as family and work in addition to preparing for the future. <i>Should I bother pouring countless hours and mountains of effort into learning to code when the payoff isn't certain?</i>. Here is the thing, when you stumble on something that you really enjoy doing it isn't "work" at all. That isn't to say that learning something new doesn't require effort, it is just effort that you don't mind spending time on. If you want to code go out there and find something you are passionate about. The tech community is massive and there is something for everyone, from artists to engineers.</p>

                <h4>Don't Be Afaid to Fail</h4>
                <p>The word failure comes with a negative connotation. I think it is paritally how we are brought up to think due to how the education system is set up. We have tests, grades and we congratulate students that are exceptional. That is all well and good, but failure IS learning as long as you keep at it. Each time we try something and fail at it we are presented with an opportunity to exlore for a solution. In the end you will walk away with a better appeciation for the topic and you will know where things can go wrong. In my books that is more valuable than doing it corrently the first time. Get out there and make mistakes! That is how you REALLY learn. <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/books/how-passion-perseverance-and-true-grit-build-geniuses-who-are-made-rather-than-born">Check out this article on how grit and perseverance is what really matters!</a></p>
