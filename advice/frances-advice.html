			<h4>Code consistently</h4>
			<p>When I first started, I would speed through projects then put down coding for several days. When I would get back to learning to code, it was hard to pick up where I left off. I've learned that code knowledge is a muscle. If you don't work it out consistently, you'll lose your gains.</p>
			<p>For me, going for more than one day without coding is enough to slide me off my game. If I know I won't be able to get coding time, I have to mentally prepare myself for playing catch-up the next time, so I don't get frustrated with myself.<p>
