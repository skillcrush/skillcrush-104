				<h2>"Keep pedaling"</h2>
				<p>Learning can be challenging, especially if it is something strange and abstract. However, learning is still possible. It will take time, but let time not discourage you. It will take patience, but getting frustrated is part of the journey and oh boy, when you finally make your code do what you intended it to do, the sense of accomplishment is so satisfying.</p>

				<p>Remember that time when you learned how to ride a bicycle? You started out with your training wheels. You did not know how to balance yourself on it but you kept on pedaling. Keep on pedaling, because sooner or later you will find your balance. Keep on coding, fail, get frustrated but keep on coding because I guarantee you that every line of code you write is another line of code closer to being a full fledge developer.<span> Just keep pedaling!</span></p>

				<h2>Let go of fear</h2>
				<p>You belong. Say it again, you belong. Be confident and if you are not, that is okay, fake it. But do it, because you know you belong even if that little voice in your head says you do not. Do not fall for that little voice. You are intelligent, dilligent and a hard worker. And keep saying it, you belong.</p>

				<h2>Things that helped me out:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Google - You can find anything there!</li>
					<li>Failure, failure failure - Use it as fuel.</li>
					<li>Talk to yourself - Ask why your code is not working, you know the answer, so ask yourself.</li>
					<li>Practice - There is no other way to learn.</li>
					<li>Take a break - Trust me on this one. A refreshed mind makes reading code easier.</li>
					<li>Enjoy it - Success should be fun.</li>
				</ul>
