			<h4>Take a deep breath, <span>relax!</span></h4>
			<p>In Yoga and meditation, we are taught to tamper expectations. This ia a valuable approach to take when it comes to coding. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, so enjoy the journey. </p>

			<p> It is okay to acknowledge that you are uncertain or not quite sure how this coding thing works.  Progress is attained when you ask questions. Ask as many questions as you need, until the answer resonates with you as a fact and not a premise.</p>

			<h4>There is a learning curve.</h4>
			<p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

			<p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
