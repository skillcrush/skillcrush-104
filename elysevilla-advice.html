			<h4>Read <strong>All<strong> of the Directions </h4>
				<p>Fair warning, this might be silly advice, but I cannot tell you how many times I've been stuck halfway through a project only to realize that I just <em>skimmed</em> the directions.</p>
				<p>It is so worth your time to read the entire document before ever opening your text editor</p>
			<h4>Fake it Til you Make it!</h4>
			<p>When I first started, I didn't think I was a 'techie.' What Skillcrush has shown me is that as long as you put in the work, you can be anything you want.</p>
			<p>Every step of the way I have faked it, taken <strong>so many notes</strong>, then practiced until I felt comfortable. Maybe this isn't something everyone needs to do, but for this upcoming 'techie' it has made a huge difference</p>
			<h4>The internet is <em>amazing!</em></h4>
			<p>While it might feel like a very new skill to you, the internet has been there, done that! Use guides, forums, customer service, anything you need to make you more knowledgable.</p>
