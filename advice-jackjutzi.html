			<h4>Driven into Madness</h4>
			<p>As you learn to code, you will walk on the edge of insanity from time to time.  This is normal.  Code that you think should work, won't.  The best skill you can learn is research.  Learning how to find the solution to your particular problem in a timely manner using the internet will be invaluable.</p>

			<p>Highs and lows are the norm.  There will be times you feel like you're a mad genius who's unstoppable, other times you will feel like a helpless puppy who can't get over the fence.  This is the life of a developer. The only key is that you keep learning and moving forward.</p>
